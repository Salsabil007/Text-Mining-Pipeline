J,"Foy, AM",,,,"Foy, Anna M.",,,Historical poetics and the definition of epic in the eighteenth century,LITERATURE COMPASS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADITION; MILTON; GENRE,"What was the epic for eighteenth-century Anglophone readers and writers? And how did those expectations differ from later definitions of the genre? This paper advocates an approach to historical poetics centered on these questions. Older approaches to historical poetics, including Mikhail Bakhtin's influential theory of the novel, impose modern ideas of post-Miltonic decline and modern expectations of epic as a rigid, half-moribund, classic genre, representative of an inaccessible, absolute past. Yet eighteenth-century writers approached the epic as a living genre defined by its capacity to form the manners, even in the present moment. Resurrecting this lost understanding could provide a large-scale analytical framework supportive of various kinds of historicist research now prevalent in eighteenth-century studies-book history, intellectual history, theory, criticism, and the digital humanities-to accommodate new models for thinking about the rise and fall of genres. The most obvious payoffs are local. Reviving old definitions of epic accommodates an earlier hierarchy of poetic making in which translation was not deemed inferior to original composition, and in which epic canons were not yet dominated by Homer and Dante. Alternative contemporary approaches to historical poetics and genre assert the primacy of philosophically-logical definitions of genre, or of generic rules derived from hyper-canonical examples; the present approach seeks newfound coherence in the previously marginalized or misunderstood. Historical poetics can unearth forgotten connections, reveal the eighteenth century as something other than an epic wasteland, and-by recovering lost abstractions-facilitate more global, cross-linguistic comparisons than familiar, racialized, Western-centered ideas of epic encourage. Recovering lost generic definitions also demands meta-critical reflection on the descriptive limitations of modern(ist) conceptions, including confidence in genre memory. The case of the epic demonstrates that genres do not always remember their pasts. Even classic genres suffer desuetude and deprecation that modern interpreters must work imaginatively to overcome.","[Foy, Anna M.] Univ Alabama, Dept English, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA","Foy, AM (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept English, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.",amf0020@uah.edu,,,,,,89,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1741-4113,,,LIT COMPASS,Lit.

But it had a secret: the company was majority owned by the London parent. As the US came to eclipse the UK, the arrangement led to growing tensions. Finally, in 1951, London was persuaded to sell its stake. But the UK firm found itself unable to use the family name for a new American venture, sparking a legal fight that lasted until 2002. This account of an important event in publishing history adds new detail from archival sources, supporting a fresh reading and correcting earlier errors. It also brings into view a significant amount of material that is published for the first time.

WhileNox's uniquely monumental form has invited analyses particularly by scholars of media studies and book history, this article focuses instead onNox's conceptualization at the intersection of elegy and epitaph. I argue thatNox's peculiar contribution to contemporary elegy arises from its merging of the long poem elegy with the epitaph, resulting in a poetics of loss that is at once expansive and economical. As such,Noxembodies the paradox of an epitaph in long verse form, a form marked by a unique style of ironic economic rationalism. Further, I argue thatNoxrequires reading strategies that take into account both its materiality as a textual artefact and its simultaneous excess of that materiality, insofar as it can be read as a further unfolding from earlier phases of Carson's work with elegy and epitaph, especiallyEconomy of the Unlost(1999).","[Wiesenthal, Christine] Univ Alberta, Dept English & Film Studies, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Wiesenthal, C (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept English & Film Studies, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",,,,,,,43,0,0,0,0,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0042-0247,1712-5278,,U TORONTO QUART,Univ.

It does so by analysing how Lukacs' concepts of the dialectic of subject and object, ideology, reification, reified consciousness matter today in the context of big data and digital capitalism. The essay shows that History and Class Consciousness' critique of reification, ideology, and reified consciousness remains highly topical in the age of digital capitalism and big data. Lukacs' analysis allows us to critically analyse how social media, big data, and various other Internet technologies are used as tools of reification. At the same time, Lukacs reminds us that only human praxis can establish alternatives.","[Fuchs, Christian] Univ Westminster, London, England","Fuchs, C (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, London, England.",c.fuchs@westminster.ac.uk,,"Fuchs, Christian/0000-0003-0589-4579",,,,45,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

However, they deserve an important part in a long-term history of types of 'close distance' and forms of segregational coexistence. Different from recent studies that stress a strong overall interaction, understanding, sharing, and exchange between Europeans and Ottoman subjects, it is proposed to distinguish three levels: (1) The daily commercial interaction of Western Europeans with their Ottoman counterparts; (2) the stronger involvement in some politico-religious struggles (the 1724 schism in the patriarchate of Antioch serves as example): also here, one has still to distinguish between real interest in the religious cause and other activities as credit lending; (3) the care for and maintenance by the Europeans of their own Western national culture abroad: these cultural activities served more to (eventually unconsciously) perform 'boundary work' and to close up the 'nation'. These early modern forms of close distance and segregation were only isomorphic but not homologous with later highly conscious colonial and modern imperial forms of contact between 'West' and 'East' as in the nineteenth-century European settlements in Istanbul.","[Zwierlein, Cornel] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Zwierlein, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Friedrich Meinecke Inst, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",cornel.zwierlein@fu-berlin.de,,,"DFG Heisenberg-StelleGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [GZ Zw 164/8-1]; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [69, GZ Zw 164/7-1]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by DFG Heisenberg-Stelle GZ Zw 164/8-1, Library database work (see n. 69) funded by DFG project GZ Zw 164/7-1, with my PhD student Sebastian Jessegus collaborating.",,92,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1611-8944,2631-9764,,J MOD EUR HIST,J.

The preface is highly significant for the reflections it contains on Melanchthon's education, scholarship, and service to the Church. In particular, it offers special insight into the perennial debate over the Wittenberg professor concerning his humanism and its relation to the Reformation. Nearly all subsequent editions of Melanchthon's works in the early modern period became implicated in some fashion in often bitter intra-Lutheran conflicts. The fact that this preface and the edition in which it appeared predates these conflicts is another reason to investigate it.

In addition to her achievements as actress, playwright, novelist, and poet, her career as editor and translator reveals much about women's agency and their role in cultural transmission across national boundaries and historical periods. Consideration of her engagement with these roles allows for an exploration of intercultural transfer, book history, translation theory, as well as developments in literary criticism and editing. Griffith's engagement with translation and adaptation as a literary process, including adaptation for pedagogical purposes, is also particularly revealing of trends and literary tastes of those in both Britain, and Ireland, where she spent much of her time, as well as reflective of those in previous generations in France. Griffith's collections, especially her 1777 project A Collection of Novels, a 3-volume edition of earlier male and female writers, also play a significant role in foundational considerations of the novel, and its rise, with Griffith's introductions and prefaces exploring the nature of the form and its association with morality. Griffith's collections afforded an example to those of her own sex in both Ireland and Britain, encouraging new publications and celebrating writing by women. Engagement with Griffith's Collection enhances our understanding of translation and editorial work as a channel for female expression and self-construction in the eighteenth century.","[Prendergast, Amy] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch English, Eighteenth Century Writing, Dublin, Ireland","Prendergast, A (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch English, Eighteenth Century Writing, Dublin, Ireland.",prendea1@tcd.ie,,"Prendergast, Amy/0000-0003-4092-7444",Moore Institute for the Humanities and Social Studies at the National University of Ireland Galway,This work was supported by the Moore Institute for the Humanities and Social Studies at the National University of Ireland Galway.,,39,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-9082,1747-5848,,WOMENS WRIT,Womens Writ.,APR 2,2020,27,2,,,,,184,202,,10.1080/09699082.2018.1556420,,,19,Literature,Literature,KX0DH,WOS:000521553300001,,,,,2020-08-21,

They functioned as nonverbal signatures in trade networks, and in later centuries as quasiheraldic emblems for wealthy mercantile families. They are common in medieval architecture, and were widely studied in this context by nineteenth- and early twentieth-century scholars. Their presence in books is more difficult to trace, and often crosses period boundaries as owners inscribed books acquired second hand. This article reveals a previously unexplored history of Tudor merchant's marks entered into medieval manuscript books. A number of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century merchants acquired luxury copies of literary texts produced in the fifteenth century, often circulating, gifting, or bequeathing them to others. Merchant's marks functioned as symbols of professional identity in these practices of ownership and exchange. The article considers the implications of this self-fashioning for our understanding of early modern book use, demonstrating how the ownership and social function of a book might have been detached from its contents, reflecting instead its aesthetic value, or the space it offered for memorialisation or recordkeeping.","[Park, Simon] Univ Oxford, St Annes Coll, Oxford, England","Park, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, St Annes Coll, Oxford, England.",,,,,,,39,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-1213,1477-4658,,RENAISS STUD,Renaiss.

Paradigms evolve to become a subject of inquiry. The need to acknowledge history of economic thought as a neglected but important domain of economic inquiry as an important discussion topic. During recent decades, history of economic thought has largely been abolished and has disappeared from many contemporary teaching curricula in economics. The article argues that our academic understanding of economics is incomplete if we do not respect history and understand the social embeddedness of economic institutions and social behaviour. Of course, one must distinguish between history of intellectual ideas and economic history. Both items have to be discussed separately when assessing methodological appropriateness and benefits. The argumentation is based on the work of Joseph A. Schumpeter who dealt in detail with the question why and how to deal with historiography as a tool of proper economics in his substantial introduction to the 1945 book History of Economic Analysis.","[Boegenhold, Dieter] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Fac Econ & Management, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria","Bogenhold, D (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Fac Econ & Management, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.",Dieter.boegenhold@aau.at,,"bogenhold, dieter/0000-0003-2893-3534",University of Klagenfurt,Open access funding provided by University of Klagenfurt.,,68,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1083-0898,1573-966X,,INT ADV ECON RES,Int.

Advocating the value of attending to the materiality of early modern women's texts, this article examines the semantic significance of the typography in this large volume of prophecies.

Second, these specific visual motifs are explored as indicators of Trapnel's broader religious and textual community in mid-seventeenth century England.

These are the notion that literacy is necessary to progress, the idea that the advent of printing with moveable type was a harbinger of enlightenment, and the tenet of historians' practice that written records are a necessary precondition for the discipline to function. Each of these ideologies is concerned with the practices of reading and writing, print culture, and documentation, which are intrinsic to the scholarship of book history. To identify the connections, we should read the texts of school books alongside the bibliographical and archival evidence of their materiality and mobility. The texts conveyed a lesson of European superiority indirectly by retelling the Whig narrative of English liberty. Colonial editions and other iterations were widely circulated. The article offers five examples of schoolbooks to demonstrate how they worked and how they travelled, then proposes a digital humanities solution to the historiographical and bibliographical challenges that arise.

The article focuses on the editions of Biblical text produced in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Holland and England during the era of European history when religious divisions caused by Reformation encouraged Christians to seek legitimation of their confessional choice by studying and reproducing Hebrew Scripture. The Hebrew text which the Christians published became a polemical weapon employed by different groups against their opponents and against the Jews as their common Other. Nevertheless, an interest in the original Biblical text not only fostered the development of textual criticism and Biblical scholarship but also stimulated the new scholarly inter-faith and interconfessional cooperaton. BAN collection holds copies of Daniel Bomberg's Mikraot Gedolot (1547) and Biur ha-Torah (1544), Robert Estienne's Bible (1539-1542), several polyglot Biblies (Polyglotta Complutensis, Antwerp polyglot, London polyglot) and other multilingual editions with translations into Latin and other European languages. Some of these books were part of prominent private collections, such as king Sigismundus II Augustus' library of Vilno, or the home library of bishop of Tver' Theophylactus Lopatinsky.

J,"Larionova, MC",,,,"Larionova, M. Ch.",,,The Quiet Don Bears Quiet Flood: the Don's Images in A.A. Akhmatova's Poem Requiem,NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN,,,Russian,Article,,,,,,A.A. Akhmatova; L.N. Gumilev; Requiem; the Don; Cossacks; M. Sholokhov,,"Researches have always been interested in a question why in Leningrad poem Requiem the image of the Don appears in the lullaby The quiet Don bears quiet flood. According to memoirs by E. Gerstain, Akhmatova explained it by her son's (Lev Gumilev's) life his expeditions to the Don and his favorite novel And Quiet Flows the Don by M. Sholokhov. However, commentators did not trust this evidence given by the author of memoirs and offered their own versions. They supposed that there is a connection of the Don's image, which appears in the poem, either with A.S. Pushkin's poem The Prisoner of the Caucasus, or with O. Mandel'shtam's biography and his exile to Voronezh, or with poetry by N. Gumilev and A. Blok. The author of the paper suggests readers to believe A. Akhmatova It was her son's life (not only his arrest, but also facts from his biography, his occupation) that became the closest context for the poem. The genre of lullaby is an evidence of this fact. Among folk lullabies there are songs which tell about mother's inner world and her worries, feelings. They are called poems of motherhood. In the poem A. Akhmatova creates this maternal motif of lullabies and it is addressed to her suffering son. The peculiar image in the lullaby the crescent in a cocked cap on head points to L.N. Gumilev's occupation. Everyone who is acquainted with Cossack culture recognizes here its specific historic-cultural realities. It is noticed that in Cossack folklore they respect the crescent and it collocates with infant theme of the lullaby. One of the Cossack's distinguishing features is a special way of wearing hats they wear one's hat on one side. It is recorded both in Cossacks' folk and in author's songs. L. Gumilev started to be interested in Cossacks during his expeditions to the Don in 1935 and in 1936 years. The head of the expedition and L. Gumilev's teacher was M.I. Artamonov, the author of the book History of the Khazars. In this book the connection between Khazars and Cossacks was firstly set. This theme was developed in L. Gumilev's book The Discovery of Khazaria, where Cossacks were called descendants of Brodnicis, and they in their turn were called descendants of Khazars Akhmatova came back to this theme in 1946 in the poem With local scum in the ditch.... This poem can relate to Sholokhov's And Quiet Flows the Don L. Gumilev's favorite novel. Like in the novel by Sholokhov, here she talks about dissociation and war against one's own nation. So, that was the way how L. Gumilev's expeditions, his arrests, favorite novel, M. Sholokhov, mother's destiny and her poem Requiem became intertwined. Even one deeply personal part from this poem shows how Akhmatova's lyrics turn into epos, into a story about nations' fates.","[Larionova, M.

During this period, it is noticeable, a process of nationalization of book production, in concord with a progressive nationalization of language and themes. With the significant increase in the number of Brazilian publishers working with the publication of literature, the network between different agents of the process of production, sale and reception of books have become closer, consequently providing new forms of professionalization of intellectuals. Cases such as the ones of Benjamin Costallat and Monteiro Lobato are presented and analyzed in order to make their actions more understandable as writers-publishers. For such analysis to be possible, it is necessary to pay attention to paratextual elements (prefaces, epigraphs, covers) present in old editions of the studied books, as well as personal documents. The books investigated are Urupes (1918), by Lobato; Historias e Sonhos (1920), by Lima Barreto; Fim (1921), by Medeiros and Albuquerque; Mademoiselle Cinema (1923), by Benjamin Costallat; and Amar verbo intransitivo (1927), by Mario de Andrade. Publishing activity is understood as an essentially plural action, involving several agents responsible not only for texts, but also for aspects of the materiality of the books. The Brazilian literary system gained its independence and maturity, whereas, through textual and editorial devices, a new type of reader was formed.","[Martins, Milena Ribeiro] Univ Fed Parana UFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil","Martins, MR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana UFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",milenamartins@ufpr.br,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,"UNIV FED MINAS GERAIS, FAC LETRAS",BELO HORIZONTE MS,"AV ANTONIO CARLOS, 6627 4 ANDAR-4036, BELO HORIZONTE MS, 31270-901, BRAZIL",0102-4809,2358-9787,,EIXO RODA,Eixo Roda,JAN-MAR,2020,29,1,,,,,218,236,,10.17851/2358-9787.29.1.218-236,,,19,"Literature, Romance",Literature,KY6IT,WOS:000522677200012,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-08-21,

The two chapters he removed took on a life of their own when he revised and expanded them to become The Buln-Buln and the Brolga and Rigby's Romance. To date, little is known about the textual and publication history of these novels. To address this gap, this article examines the textual history of Rigby's Romance, detailing its publication as a serial in Broken Hill's Barrier Truth, its abridgement published in 1921, and the publication of the unabridged version in 1946. The article argues that, in order to best understand the legacy of Joseph Furphy and his work, any reading of Rigby's Romance and, by association, Such is Life, must engage with the ways in which the versions of the work are entangled in the lives of editors, publishers, critics and general readers.","[Osborne, Roger] James Cook Univ, Humanities & Creat Arts, Cairns, Qld, Australia","Osborne, R (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Arts Soc & Educ, Div Trop Environm & Soc, Humanities, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",roger.osborne@jcu.edu.au,,,,,,23,1,1,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1444-3058,1835-6419,,J AUST STUD,J.

The Copyright Act 1869 (Vic) was introduced into a thriving but volatile colonial literary marketplace. The law was based almost wholly on the UK law at the time, existing in a very different environment. This article notes that despite the rhetoric of the protection of the right of authors as an aim of the law, the effect was something quite different. We examine the use of copyright by some key players in that colonial market, both publishers and authors. That analysis reveals that the prophetic words of George Higinbotham, that the law was not for the protection of the author, but the publisher, can be demonstrated to be true. This is evident both in the implementation of the law itself and in a number of inconsistencies in its operation. We conclude that, despite public and parliamentary rhetoric drawing on the romantic conception of the author as creator, the law's conception of the author as proprietor offered little protection to local Australian authors writing new literature for a new country.","[Ailwood, Sarah; Sainsbury, Maree] Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Sainsbury, M (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Fac Business Govt & Law, Canberra, ACT 2617, Australia.",maree.sainsbury@canberra.edu.au,"Ailwood, Sarah/I-6577-2013","Ailwood, Sarah/0000-0001-5153-625X; Sainsbury, Maree/0000-0001-5327-2008",,,,52,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1743-8721,1743-9752,,LAW CULT HUMANIT,Law Cult.

Suggesting that discussions of these concerns have hitherto neglected the material object of the book, I argue for the importance of paratexts (illustrations, legends, prefaces, running titles and marginal notes) as sites of negotiation over anatomy books? pornographic potential. I examine these paratexts both as strategies by which writers and printers carefully and collaboratively attempt to frustrate erotic reading, and as devices that might simultaneously function to facilitate this mode of reading. The centrality of these concerns to the construction of anatomy books indicates, I suggest, a need to augment our characterisation of early modern readers, incorporating wilfully thoughtless and/or excessive reading alongside active and productive reading. My discussion focuses on Helkiah Crooke?s Mikrokosmographia, and is supplemented with analysis of other English anatomy books published throughout the seventeenth century.","[Heyam, Kit] Univ Leeds, Sch English, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","Heyam, K (corresponding author), 5 Graham View, Leeds LS4 2NB, W Yorkshire, England.",k.r.heyam@gmail.com,,"Heyam, Kit/0000-0001-7541-7001",,,,60,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-117X,2050-4616,,SEVENTEENTH CENT,Seventeenth Century,OCT 20,2019,34,5,,,,,615,647,,10.1080/0268117X.2018.1506355,,,33,Medieval & Renaissance Studies,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,JI0RR,WOS:000493175300004,,Green Accepted,,,2020-08-21,

The comparison sheds light on different strategies involved in translating a text as an independent document or as part of a 'Collected Works' series. The discrepancies between publication contexts are correlated with differences between domesticating and foreignizing approaches, and with the diverging appreciations of Heine's place within Shakespeare criticism that such choices entail. The translators' gender politics are also shown to affect their renderings of Heine's text on female characters in Shakespeare, which was itself indebted to a book by Anna Jameson (1832). Finally, cultural transfer theory and histoire croisee are used to explore a 'retransfer' that involved British Shakespeare critics, an atypical Jewish-German writer who drew on their work, and Heine's 'English' translators. The article highlights the necessary imbrication of translation studies and book history in the analysis of complex transcultural forms of textual production, of which Shakespeare criticism is paradigmatic.","[Ingelbien, Raphael] Univ Leuven, Literary Studies, Leuven, Belgium; [Ingelbien, Raphael] Leuven Ctr Translat Studies, CETRA, Leuven, Belgium","Ingelbien, R (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Literary Studies, Leuven, Belgium.; Ingelbien, R (corresponding author), Leuven Ctr Translat Studies, CETRA, Leuven, Belgium.",,,"Ingelbien, Raphael/0000-0002-3820-2770",,,,44,0,0,2,2,EDINBURGH UNIV PRESS,EDINBURGH,"THE TUN-HOLYROOD RD, 12 2F JACKSONS ENTRY, EDINBURGH EH8 8PJ, SCOTLAND",1744-1854,1750-0109,,COMP CRIT STUD,Comp.

Tracing the trajectories of translated books and the socio-cultural, economic and legal forces shaping them, this article examines the legal battle over the translation and publishing rights of Les Lecons de chimie elementaire, a chemistry book authored by Jean Girardin and translated and published in Spanish by Jean-Frederic Rosa.

The article highlights factors relevant to this situation of foreign occupation (including events removed in time and place) and the role of agents not specifically accounted for in existing models.

Although current research directions tend to use them for studying early forms of non-European languages or for historicizing the initial stages of linguistics as a discipline, I argue that these grammars can also be examined as a translational corpus. Translation was an underlying procedure in their composition and, ultimately, in the production of linguistic knowledge under the colonial condition. This article shows how the Spanish-language grammars of Tagalog, the basis of the modern-day national language called Filipino, were produced as an academic and material response to colonialism. It traces the evolution of these grammars alongside the establishment of the printing press in the Philippines and the intricacies of Catholic missionary work. It proceeds to analyse the paratextual and linguistic contents of the grammars and the translation strategies employed in their creation.

Trubner's monthly American & Oriental Literary Record (1865-) shows pages and pages of imported Sanskrit books, but also books in Hindi, Hindustani, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Gujarati, Arabic, Persian, and so on. Trubner also imported Peruvian, Argentinian, Brazilian, Yucatanese and other books from Latin America. Yet this impressive circulation and presence of books did not translate into their recognition as world literature. Voluminous compendia like John Macy's The Story of World Literature (1927) cover Asian Literature in merely thirteen pages (out of five hundred), and fail to mention any modern Indian writer apart from Rabindranath Tagore, damning him with faint praise. Why was this material presence and circulation of books in non-European languages in Britain and other parts of Europe matched by their absence as modern literary texts from the imagination of world literature?

This paper proposes that there is an important sociological and economic element of the book history of the posthumous writings of Burns and to a lesser extent, Tannahill, that has yet to receive its deserved attention. The essay addresses the question as to how the compositions of Burns and (other poets) became available to those of limited income, particularly during the first third of the nineteenth century. This availability is elucidated and traced through their appearances in a major form of popular print in Britain - the chapbook. Quite how the chapbook printers addressed matters of authorship are considered, as are the problems associated with the publication of variant titles and textual content of the Scottish poets' works. The ambiguities and challenges caused by the very song titles adopted by the printers are delineated: some material that may appear to have been by Burns is not his work at all. The falling away of the chapbook form from (roughly) the 1830s, and the absorption of Burns's work into the 'cheap reprint' movement from the mid-nineteenth century is outlined.","[Beavan, Iain] Univ Glasgow, Sch Crit Studies, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Beavan, I (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Crit Studies, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,27,0,0,0,0,ASSOC SCOTTISH LIT STUD,OLD ABERDEEN,"UNIV ABERDEEN DEPT OF ENGLISH, OLD ABERDEEN AB9 2UB, SCOTLAND",1756-5634,2050-6678,,SCOTT LIT REV,Scott.

Using a case study of the Marian tradition in Ireland in the mid-19th century, the article questions how the wide circulation of translated religious texts could serve to create a sense of national uniqueness, but also to establish links to a global religious community, particularly in the context of the sectarian dispute. Informed by book history, the article considers the diffusion of ideas and practices through textual trails, the mechanisms of this diffusion, and the societal agency involved in the circulation of texts. It argues that the intersection between translation, reading, and religion furthered a sense of identification within a religious community and contributed to understandings of both textual and spiritual faithfulness.","[O'Connor, Anne] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Languages Literatures & Cultures, Galway, Ireland","O'Connor, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Languages Literatures & Cultures, Galway, Ireland.",anne.oconnor@nuigalway.ie,,"O'Connor, Anne/0000-0002-2458-2223",,,,65,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0048-721X,1096-1151,,RELIGION,Religion,JUL 3,2019,49,3,,,SI,,439,457,,10.1080/0048721X.2019.1622839,,JUL 2019,19,Religion,Religion,IQ2XM,WOS:000474113600001,,,,,2020-08-21,

The first edition of Hamlet - often called 'Q1', shorthand for 'first quarto' - was published in 1603, in what we might regard as the early modern equivalent of a cheap paperback. Q1 Hamlet is becoming increasingly canonical not because there is universal agreement about what it is or what it means, but because more and more Shakespearians agree that it is worth arguing about. If we read or perform it, rather than simply dismissing it (as was done for most of the twentieth century), Q1 makes us think: about performance, book history, Shakespeare's relationships with his contemporaries, and the shape of his whole career.","[Bourus, Terri] Florida State Univ, Theatre, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Bourus, Terri] Florida State Univ, English, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Bourus, T (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Theatre, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Bourus, T (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, English, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,BERGHAHN JOURNALS,BROOKLYN,"20 JAY ST, SUITE 512, BROOKLYN, NY 11201 USA",0011-1570,1752-2293,,CRIT SURV,Crit.

The institutional and linguistic conditions for this exchange changed significantly during the nineteenth century. For Swedish scientists, the symbolic translation of scientific capital depended on the literal translation of texts, from Swedish as well as into Swedish. I focus on two cases that highlight the complex and changing relations between prizes and publications in Swedish science, approaching them from the perspective of language and translation: the judgements delivered by the chemist Berzelius in his journal Annual Survey of Progress in the Sciences (1821-1848), and the Letterstedt Prizes of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1862-).","[Beckman, Jenny] Uppsala Univ, Dept Hist Sci & Ideas, Uppsala, Sweden","Beckman, J (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Hist Sci & Ideas, Uppsala, Sweden.",Jenny.Beckman@idehist.uu.se,,,Marianne & Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Chemical Heritage Foundation,"This paper has been written with the support of the project Science and Modernization in Sweden, funded by the Marianne & Marcus Wallenberg Foundation, as well as a fellowship from the Chemical Heritage Foundation.

By surveying the scholarly output of book historians working with mapping technologies, it is possible to conclude that, in the print book ecosystem, there exist a handful of markers identifying the following categories: places associated with a book's setting, its author, its publication, its purchase, and its marketing and publicity. The latter three markers look substantially different in the ebook ecosystem than in the print book ecosystem.

Further, they were often used for less guided writing activities. The owners left notes, lists and sometimes even sketches in the margins or on blank pages between the texts. Among these, lists of life dates of relatives are a valuable source for studies on domestic devotion. On the one hand, they give glimpses on the composition of households. How many people lived together and who were they? These lists inform us about names regardless of gender. On the other hand, the penning of these list is in itself a trace of a practice intricately tied to the familial and domestic spheres.

J,"Rials, E",,,,"Rials, Emily",,,The politics of punctuation in Jacob's Room and Between the Acts,TEXTUAL PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Punctuation; disability; narrative; book history; modernism; Virginia Woolf; parenthesis,WOOLF,"While much critical analysis explores modernist poets' experiments with the printed page, the print innovations of prose writers have been largely overlooked. Punctuation offered many modernist novelists a way to engage visually with marginalised or non-normative experiences of embodiment; many chose to remove punctuation in order to minimise 'obstructions' or impediments for characters and readers, but Virginia Woolf instead employed specific marks and space breaks to divide and animate her novels' printed spaces. This article demonstrates how the pages of Jacob's Room and Between the Acts integrate punctuation and spacing into the novels' fraught representations of disability and gender. While Jacob's Room frames blank space as a narrative resource for grappling with the difficulty of representing the 'unseizable' components of embodied life, the parentheses and ellipses of Between the Acts visually mark the opacity and ambiguity of each character's social performance, placing visible pressure on any easy reading of Albert, a disabled pageant performer, or of Miss La Trobe, the marginalised artist-figure. Unpacking how punctuation and space affect these novels' representations of characters' embodied experiences, I argue, emphasises the importance of attending to bibliographic materiality as well as linguistic complexity when analysing modernist novels' narrative innovations.","[Rials, Emily] Cornell Univ, Dept English, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Rials, E (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept English, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ekr34@cornell.edu,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-236X,1470-1308,,TEXTUAL PRACT,Textual Pract.,APR 21,2019,33,4,,,,,519,539,,10.1080/0950236X.2017.1308964,,,21,Literature,Literature,HY2KY,WOS:000467951200008,,,,,2020-08-21,

However, the authoritarian state-socialism of Hungary permitted only apologetic theorizations, using the Marxist critique of capitalist society and culture to justify its own form of domination. But even to philosophers of the Frankfurt School in Germany the reality of authoritarian socialism was a challenge they refused to confront. Was a critical theory in state-socialist societies even possible? And if so, how did it affect the theory of architecture? As in other state-socialist countries, architectural debates in Hungary between 1960 and 1990 displayed conflicting lines of thought. Critical theory was indeed possible in state-socialist Hungary, and it gave rise to the development of two characteristic positions: insistence on the 'specificity' of architecture, on the one hand, and the critique of 'etatist' planning, on the other. Both largely developed on a neo-Marxist or a post-Marxist basis. Therefore, the critique of a system that claimed the Marxian tradition for itself meant rejecting a monolithic 'critical theory', analyzing the objectivations, institutions and practices of state-socialist society.","[Moravanszky, Akos] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland","Moravanszky, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",akos.moravanszky@gta.arch.ethz.ch,,,,,,33,1,1,0,0,UBIQUITY PRESS LTD,LONDON,"2N, 6 OSBORNE ST, LONDON, E1 6TD, ENGLAND",2050-5833,,,ARCHIT HIST-LONDON,Archit.

Many of the changes in the definition of the ideal woman were appropriated from Britain, but the definition also differed. In general, these differences have been overlooked by academia as there is a prevailing assumption that South African women's views on gender either reflected British trends or differed only in terms of the suffrage movement and racial views. I argue that studying popular magazines and literature at the time will provide a clearer indication of how women negotiated their roles as these are polyphonic texts that do not merely reflect one author's view. Using an intertextual approach this study looks at a popular magazine from the time, the South African Lady's Pictorial and Home Journal, as well as several of the South African novels reviewed in the magazine to trace the conversation over the period in question. Through discourse analysis, major trends and changes in those trends have been identified to show how white English-speaking women defined womanhood at a time when there were great changes and challenges to gender norms.","[Venter, Isabella J.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Min Engn, Pretoria, South Africa","Venter, IJ (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Min Engn, Pretoria, South Africa.",isabella.venter@up.ac.za,,"Venter, Isabella/0000-0002-7519-1687",,,,151,0,0,0,0,UNISA PRESS,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-2473,1726-1686,,S AFR HIST J,S.-Afr.

Written in late autumn 1159 for Thomas Becket, chancellor of King Henri II Plantagenet and future archbishop of Canterbury, the work has been abundantly studied for its political content, as a mirror for princes. If research has since nuanced this characterization, by stressing in particular the humanistic culture of the text, praising John's knowledge of the classics, few studies have been devoted to the precise diffusion of the text through the manuscript tradition. Our research has two objectives: on the one hand, to propose an overview of the first diffusion of the Policraticus in France, which was facilitated by the simultaneous stay of John of Salisbury and Thomas Becket in Champagne during the years 1164-1170; on the other hand, to understand the function and the place occupied in this diffusion by the manuscript Charleville-Mezieres BM 151, which comes from the Cistercian abbey of Signy.

This article examines how submissions from authors were screened by trusted readers before acceptance and hence begins to elucidate the origins of peer review in the discipline's first English language journal. Whilst there has been extensive examination of geographic texts, hitherto there has not been any systematic examination of institutional peer review's governance of geographic knowledge. Historians of science, however, have begun to historicise peer review within scientific fields. This paper adds to these studies, by bringing a discipline on the periphery of science in the nineteenth century into dialogue with the history of peer review. Through detailed assessment of authors' manuscripts and their associated correspondence, this study reflects on the development of mechanisms that authorised geographic knowledge in the society's journal. It further examines how individual reviewers interpreted and practiced the society's procedures. Overall it demonstrates how peer review was central in shaping the geography that appeared in the pages of The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting with a South African poem as an example, the piece sets out a definition of the term before outlining the existing literary scholarship that could fall under its umbrella. The article then turns to discuss hydrocolonial book history and what we might learn by tracing books on their oceanic journeys. One important node in these journeys was the port city, where customs and excise officials examined texts to see whether they were pirated, seditious, or obscene. These inspectors in effect functioned as censors and adjudicators of copyright. The article examines how these protocols worked in practice and concludes by discussing this dockside mode of reading as a hydrocolonial literary formation.","[Hofmeyr, Isabel] Univ Witwatersrand, African Literature, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Hofmeyr, Isabel] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA","Hofmeyr, I (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, African Literature, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Hofmeyr, I (corresponding author), NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,National Research Foundation,"I acknowledge the support of the National Research Foundation, which enabled research undertaken toward this article.",,37,4,4,0,0,UNIV COLORADO,BOULDER,"125 HELLEMS BLDG, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA",0013-8282,,,ENGL LANG NOTES,Engl.

Figurative sets produced for other poems, mostly illustrations inspired by the Morgante and the Furioso, were instead deployed to accompany Boiardo's octaves. The essay analyses the figurative reception of the Inamoramento during the sixteenth century, focusing on prominent printing houses that published the poem using engravings that were already available. The essay examines the strategies adopted in reusing the images, paying special attention to how the Furioso's illustrations were readapted so as to emphasize the relationships between the Inamoramento and its sequel. At the end of the eighteenth century the Inamoramento was eventually illustrated with original engravings. The analysis of the reception of Boiardo's poem through these different phases makes clear how the dynamics of mutual influence connecting the Inamoramento with its sequel also had a visual dimension.","[Rizzarelli, Giovanna] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Pisa, Italy","Rizzarelli, G (corresponding author), Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Pisa, Italy.",giovanna.rizzarelli@sns.it,,,,,,62,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0075-1634,1748-6181,,ITAL STUD,Ital.

This article sets out to read Wannus through his library. After presenting a brief overview of the books in Wannus' library, their subject matter, and their provenance, it examines personal book inscriptions, which unravel a rich intellectual network and provide insight into Wannus' trajectory and recognition as a playwright and public intellectual. It then explores the conditions under which Wannus' library came into existence and flourished in a Syria marked by the Bath party and the al-Asad regime's authoritarian control of the political and cultural fields, under which it migrated from Damascus to Beirut in the wake of the 2011 Syrian revolution-turned-war. Wannus' library, the article argues, opened an Arabic and world literary space, both physical and metaphorical, from which Wannus emerged as a modern Arabic and world-renowned playwright.","[Mejcher-Atassi, Sonja] Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon","Mejcher-Atassi, S (corresponding author), Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.",sm78@aub.edu.lb,,,,,,88,0,0,0,1,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0085-2376,1570-064X,,J ARABIC LIT,J.

This book contained some of the first references to loess deposits in the geological literature. It also contained a detailed geological map of the region around the Laacher See which showed the distribution of the loess. Hibbert had some influence on Charles Lyell and was acknowledged in the brief loess section when volume 3 of the Principles of Geology was published in 1833. Loess was effectively announced in 1824 by Karl Caesar von Leonhard in Heidelberg, and made well known by Lyell in 1833. Between 1824 and 1833 Hibbert produced some of the first studies in English. He was a student at Edinburgh University at the same time as Ami Boue (c.1815-1818) and he was much influenced by Boue, on basins, on large floods, and on the nature of loess. He deserves to be recognised as a significant loess pioneer; he was included in the list of loessic savants produced by Lyell in 1833: Leonhard, Bronn, Boue, Voltz, Steininger, Merian, Rozet, Hibbert. He eventually had an unfortunate relationship with Lyell (and other geologists) and the loessic link was soon severed. The 1832 book was his only loessic contribution to geo-scholarship.

Through writing that was possible. Since Ancient Mesopotamian times until the Roman Empire, without forgetting oral societies, such as the Greek world, the introduction of the alphabet changed ancient societies - the book became a perennial possibility of that legacy, from papyri scrolls to the codex. Although Greeks were immersed in that predominant oral culture, step by step the writing word was introduced. In the V century B.C., books began to assume gradual importance in Greece, and later on, in the first century, Roman poetry recognized the relevance of writing materials. The spreading of bookshops and publishers allowed book trade to develop. Despite the absence of an author's rights protection, in the very poetical compositions we can find testimonies of the reasons that lead authors to publish: whether to attain immortality or to seek a more rapid circulation of their works. Still, we cannot forget that the material where those works were kept was a perishable and a fragile one.","[Santos, Alexandra] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Estudos Class & Humanisticos, Coimbra, Portugal","Santos, A (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Estudos Class & Humanisticos, Coimbra, Portugal.",alexasantos54@hotmail.com,,"Santos, Alexandra/0000-0001-5295-3039",,,,41,0,0,0,0,UNIV COIMBRA,COIMBRA,"RUA DA ILHA, COIMBRA, 3000-214, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-26-1711-4; 978-989-26-1710-7,,,,2019,,,,,,,207,248,,10.14195/978-989-26-1711-4_6,10.14195/978-989-26-1711-4,,42,Anthropology; History,Anthropology; History,BO4JF,WOS:000514295200008,,Bronze,,,2020-08-21,

The publisher David Corazzi (845-1896) savvy commercial strategy helped the publication to attain an immense success in Portugal and Brazil. The first sixteen numbers had print runs of 10 000 copies or more. At the time these numbers were unusually high in Portugal. Conceptually the BPE falls in line with international publishing dynamics of the second half of the nineteenth century. The development of new printing technologies led to a price decrease of printed materials, namely that of periodicals: newspapers, magazines and fascicles. The widespread belief that popular classes needed instruction implied an increased investment in public education, particularly at the primary level. Naturally higher literacy led to a larger number of potential readers. Both the publisher and Xavier da Cunha (1840-1920), the first editor of the collection, claimed that foreign models inspired the creation of BPE. Notwithstanding neither referred a specific model. So far these statements have been interpreted to mean that an editorial strategy similar to other publications was implemented, i.e. low cost educational volumes organized into a virtual library. In this article we argue that the Biblioteca del Popolo, published from 1875 onwards, in Milan, by the publisher Edoardo Sonzogno (1836-1920) constituted, in fact, the BPE model. We further conclude that the specificities of the Portuguese publication reflect an editorial strategy targeting the Brazilian and educational markets.","[Bonifacio, Vitor] Univ Aveiro, Dept Fis, Ctr Invest Didat & Tecnol Formacao Prof, Aveiro, Portugal","Bonifacio, V (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Fis, Ctr Invest Didat & Tecnol Formacao Prof, Aveiro, Portugal.",vitor.bonifacio@ua.pt,,"Bonifacio, Vitor/0000-0001-7412-6704",,,,57,0,0,0,0,UNIV COIMBRA,COIMBRA,"RUA DA ILHA, COIMBRA, 3000-214, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-26-1711-4; 978-989-26-1710-7,,,,2019,,,,,,,313,339,,10.14195/978-989-26-1711-4_9,10.14195/978-989-26-1711-4,,27,Anthropology; History,Anthropology; History,BO4JF,WOS:000514295200011,,Bronze,,,2020-08-21,

Eliot's grammar was first published in 1666, but by the early 1800s had been mostly forgotten. Applying book history and critical discourse approaches, I argue the new 1822 edition assembled by Pickering and Du Ponceau was at the center of a newly emergent knowledge project aimed to establish an 'American' mode of comparative linguistics on the world intellectual stage:the grammatical analysis of Native American languages, especially Algonquin, and the critique of current European models and typologies of morphology and syntax, especially von Humboldt's, were central to Pickering and Du Ponceau's project. Du Ponceau may be the father of American philology, but he was not working alone nor did the concept of 'Comparative Philology' derive solely from Du Ponceau. Rather, Du Ponceau was the strategist for a more collaborative, organized approach based on the study of American Indian languages. The new edition of Eliot's grammar reveals how Du Ponceau and Pickering were establishing an informal research network devoted to North American indigenous languages. The production and arrangement of their book depended on a broad, complex, and ultimately institutionally-supported network of scholars and amateur linguists. Their edition also shows how Du Ponceau and Pickering responded to the underlying ideological debate over savage languages with an emergent discourse grounded in Native American languages, 'facts', and 'scientific' linguistics.","[Amsler, Mark E.] Univ Auckland, Sch Cultures Languages & Linguist, Fac Arts, Auckland 1142, New Zealand","Amsler, ME (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Cultures Languages & Linguist, Fac Arts, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",mark.amsler@gmail.com,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,JOHN BENJAMINS PUBLISHING CO,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 ME AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0302-5160,1569-9781,,HIST LINGUIST,Historiogr.

Their goal was to create an institution capable of preparing specialists not only for the Academy itself, but also for the civil service, which required people educated in both Russian and German. The regulation (reglament) developed by Georg Krafft in 1739, besides preserving the previous division of the gymnasium into Latin and German departments, redesigned the instruction offered by the German department to form a full curriculum, in which Russian-style instruction was as important as mastering the German language. This visionary project put together classes in which pupils whose native language was Russian would study in the same classroom as students whose native language was German, which led the Academy to develop a corpus of bilingual (German/Russian) textbooks. A key element of the syllabus was the study of a Russian author (analogous to the well-developed system of reading authors in European Latin schools), the first time this method had been introduced in a Russian school. Gottlieb Siegfried Bayer's Azov History (Begebenheiten von Azow, 1736-37), translated into Russian by Ivan Taubert (1737), was chosen as the set text. The whole syllabus provided by Krafft's 1739 gymnasium regulation, as well as the book-selling practice of the Academy in the early 1740s, makes it clear that the selection of Bayer's book was not coincidental - it corresponded well to the Russian reading public's ideas about proper verbal composition. The marginal status of verse (poetry) in this structure, combined with the actors' attention to questions of style, provide the basis for a new narrative for Russian literary history of the 1730s, centered around the collective work of the translators of the under-studied Russian Society (Rossijskoe sobranie), established in 1735. Such a narrative would consider the whole catalogue of books published by the Academy, whether in Russian or in other languages.","[Kostin, Andrey Aleksandrovich] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Kostin, Andrey Aleksandrovich] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Russian Literature, Pushkin House, St Petersburg, Russia; [Kostina, Tatyana Vladimirovna] Russian Acad Sci, St Petersburg Inst Hist, St Petersburg, Russia","Kostin, AA (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.; Kostin, AA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Russian Literature, Pushkin House, St Petersburg, Russia.",akostin@hse.ru; tatianav.kostina@gmail.com,"Kostina, Tatiana/AAO-3263-2020","Kostina, Tatiana/0000-0002-5136-4328",,,,40,0,0,0,0,"RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES, INST SLAVIC STUDIES",MOSCOW,"LENINSKII PROSPEKT, DOM 32A, MOSCOW, 119334, RUSSIA",2304-0785,2305-6754,,SLOV-INT J SLAV STUD,Slovene,,2019,8,2,,,,,163,197,,10.31168/2305-6754.2019.8.2.6,,,35,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,KQ3IV,WOS:000516821100006,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-08-21,

The incorporation of material elements into the picturebook narrative at the same time extends reading beyond a purely cognitive activity: the reader enacts and interprets the narrative by interacting physically with the architectural space of the book. In Katsumi Komagata's Blue to Blue, the paper steps forward to take up a significant narrative role rather than retreating as the decorative backdrop or mere material support for the visual and textual elements. Not only do the qualities of the paper like texture, transparency and luminosity evoke features of the landscapes and characters in the story, but the shapes of the paper and the die-cuts also create physical depth and form characters that spring into life at the turning, poking and caressing of the reader's hands.","[Huang, Honglan] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Huang, HL (corresponding author), Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",honglan.huang@yale.edu,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,CROATIAN ASSOC RESEARCHERS CHILDRENS LITERATURE,ZAGREB,"SAVSKA CESTA 77, ZAGREB, HR-10000, CROATIA",1848-3488,1848-5871,,LIBRI LIBERI,Libri Liberi,,2019,8,2,,,,,293,311,,10.21066/carcl.libri.8.2.3,,,19,Literature,Literature,KG8HJ,WOS:000510188900005,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2020-08-21,

Part 1 examines the persistent failure of African governments to support their book industries and public libraries in a tangible and positive fashion. It reviews the current status of book development councils in Africa, the unsatisfactory progress in establishing national book policies, the challenges of generating book industry data, and the opportunities presented to African publishers by the new digital environment.

Digital enumerative bibliography uses bibliographical structures within a relational database that allows researchers to track more relevant metadata such as geographical location of subject matter, language, and time period. Whereas traditional enumerative bibliographies use a hierarchy of textual data, a relational database creates a nexus that facilitates new kinds of research queries. As an example, we offer our digital project the Women in Book History Bibliography and use its 1,550 citations as a dataset to trace what is women's book history. We then advocate for digital enumerative bibliography as a form of feminist recovery efforts that recovers not only primary texts but scholarship about them.","[Coker, Cait] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Ozment, Kate] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Pomona, CA 91768 USA","Coker, C (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",cait@illinois.edu; keozment@cpp.edu,,,Beth Qualls Endowed Fellowship,Our thanks to the 2017 conference of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism for their feedback on an early draft of this essay.

Taking as a case study McLuhan's copies of James Joyce's Ulysses in the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto, this article asks what we can learn about McLuhan's reading from close analysis of his own books. Analysis The article begins with a discussion of McLuhan's media theory as applied Joyce, with particular reference to Ulysses, and then turns to an overview of the annotation techniques and strategies visible in McLuhan's copies of the novel.

J,"Brilkman, K",,,,"Brilkman, Kajsa",,,"When did the Reformation end? Reformation, confessionalization and the representation of Martin Luther in Swedish 16th-century print",HISTORISK TIDSKRIFT,,,Swedish,Article,,,,,,Reformation; Confessionalization; Martin Luther; Lutheran confessional culture; Book History,EMPIRE,"In the past decades, Swedish scholars have used the concept of the Reformation to refer to a long process of religious change in Sweden between 1527 and 1593. The influence from the term the long reformation used in the Anglo-Saxon world is tangible. Instead, this essay argues for a temporally narrower concept of reformation, which clarifies changes and differences in the 16th century and places Sweden in a European context. Representations (in text or images) of Martin Luther in 16th-century books for a Swedish reading audience are analysed with a view to how differences in representation reflect changes in religious life and society over the century. The article argues that the term the Reformation should be reserved for the first half of the century and the struggle to reform what everyone at the time thought of as the universal church. In this period print was an arena where different views about Luther and the religious process of change were created and negotiated. The term confessionalization should be used for the second half of the century, highlighting the aim to stabilize the various confessional churches and to consolidate and reinforce identities and shared values. The article contrasts six years at the beginning of the period (1526-1531) with six years at the end of the period (1592-1597) to bring to light the difference between reformation and confessionalization. During the first period only three books directly represented Martin Luther by explicitly mentioning him. In the same period seven editions of books strongly connected to Luther (e.g. translations or adaptations of his works) could be identified. However, none of these mentioned Luther. This divergence between representation and reception of Luther is a typical feature of the Reformation outside the Holy German Empire. Luther was a controversial figure and there were competing interpretations of his thoughts. The second period shows an almost opposite relationship between reception and representation. Out of six analyzed books which all translated or adopted Luther's writing, five contain representations of Luther. Instead of hiding Luther, which was the norm in the earlier period, these publications draw attention to Luther. During the period of confessionalization a positive identification with Luther and his legacy became a characteristic of Swedish Lutheranism. The Swedish Reformation was not laggard but followed a European pattern. It ended in mid-century when the period of confessionalization began. Hence, the year 1593, which in traditional interpretations marks the end of the Swedish Reformation, should be understood as part of the confessionalization process.","[Brilkman, Kajsa] Lund Univ, Hist Inst, Verksam, Lund, Sweden","Brilkman, K (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Hist Inst, Verksam, Lund, Sweden.",kajsa.brilkman@hist.lu.se,,"Brilkman, Kajsa/0000-0002-2508-1594",,,,100,0,0,0,0,SVENSKA HISTORISKA FORENINGEN,STOCKHOLM,"STOCKHOLMS UNIV, UNIVERSITETSVAGEN 10, STOCKHOLM, 10691, SWEDEN",0345-469X,,,HIST TIDSKR-SWEDEN,Hist.

In addition, we are interested in reading three literary works that have as their link the burning of books in different historical and social contexts, namely: Gustavo Bernardo's The Real Magician (2008), Beto, the illiterate (2008), by Drummond Amorin and Assassinato at the Helena Gomes Library (2009), we argue that the burning of fictional books vehemently dialogues with the difficulty of access to literary works in Brazilian public schools and the neglect of rulers in order to feed policies of states that ensure that students registered in Brazilian public schools have access to work of aesthetic quality. To this end, we will rely on pioneering work on book history, such as A History of Reading (1997), Alberto Manguel and History of Reading (2006), Steven R.

Based on the fact that the main means of creating a national history is projecting contemporary ethnic categories into the distant past, the author of this article focuses on identifying those aspects of Rattkay's narrative on the early Croatian history that were caused by what is usually called ethnic discourse, that is a historically determined way of structuring social, political, and cultural reality in ethnic categories. In doing so, the author shows that the picture of the early past of the Croatian-Slavonian Kingdom, presented by Rattkay in his historical narrative, was in no way a result of connecting mechanically pieces of heterogeneous historical evidence. On the contrary, Rattkay's picture of the early past had a clear internal logic. The basis of this logic was the representation of the kingdoms of Dalmatia, Croatia, and Slavonia, on the one hand, as three components of one ethno-political organism, and on the other, as three ethno-political units, each of them having their own historical individuality. In his narrative, Rattkay adheres to the idea of the existence of three Illyrian tribes (nationes) - Dalmatians, Croats, and Slays, each of whom, in his view, inhabited its own kingdom. At the same time, all three tribes were parts of a single Illyrian nation and used the Slavic language. The political equivalent of this ethnic unity was the unity of the Illyrian kingdom, which embraced all the three kingdoms, and, as a rule, was under the rule of a single king. The idea of the existence of inseparable ties between an ethnic group (natio) and a polity (regnum) resulted in Rattkay's combining elements of Illyrianism, which was a South Slavic proto-national ideology characteristic especially for Dalmatia and the Republic of Dubrovnik, with those of the patriotism of the Croatian-Slavonian estates. Unlike the Dalmatian authors of Illyrianist tradition (Priboevie, Orbini, etc.), Rattkay did not use the term Slays (Sclavi) as a designation of all Slavic peoples, but identified Slays with the inhabitants of the kingdom of Slavonia, which was a characteristic feature of the Slavonian usage of the term. By identifying this feature of Rattkay's ethnic discourse, the author explains the genesis of such figures of Rattkay's narrative as Slavonian kings Keanus and Godescalcus. The author concludes that Rattkay's notion of the early past of the Croatian-Slavonian Kingdom was a result of his projecting a specific hybrid identity, consisting of elements of the proto-national Illyrianism and Croatian-Slavonian patriotism, deep into the centuries.","[Alimov, Denis E.] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia","Alimov, DE (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",d.alimov@spbu.ru,"Alimov, Denis/I-7188-2013","Alimov, Denis/0000-0002-4733-4150",,,,34,0,0,1,1,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",1998-8613,2311-2387,,VESTN TOMSK GOS U IS,Vestn.

The article examines not just the transnational circuits of communication of periodicals, but also the discursive practices, the agency, and the dynamic and distinct modalities of the periodical form. The nineteenth century witnessed an unprecedented expansion of periodical publishing and this article uses the case study of a nineteenth-century periodical, the Dublin University Magazine, in order to question the cultural transfers taking place, the positioning of translations within the publication, the significance of the medium of communication, and the challenges posed when studying translation in periodicals. Drawing on book history approaches, the article focuses on integrating the study of the translations within their publication context, examining how the mutable and ephemeral form of the periodical allowed for expanded textual discourses and also for widened participation in the translation enterprise.","[O'Connor, Anne] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Languages Literatures & Cultures, Italian, Galway, Ireland","O'Connor, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, NUI Galway, Sch Languages Literatures & Cultures, Galway H91T K33, Ireland.",anne.oconnor@nuigalway.ie,,"O'Connor, Anne/0000-0002-2458-2223",,,,60,1,1,5,6,JOHN BENJAMINS PUBLISHING CO,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 ME AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1932-2798,1876-2700,,TRANSL INTERPRET STU,Trans.

This essay uses contemporary scholarship on the book culture of Ilorin to shed light on Crowther's letters, in particular his triumphant account of a formal audience with the emir of Ilorin in 1872, during which his performance centred on the bilingual collection of Christian books he bore. He emphasized the uniqueness and novelty of his Christian books and their associated practices. Yet his accounts invite us to begin viewing Africa's Christian and Islamic book histories through the same analytical frame, which reveals how they were constituted in part through their interactions. This allows us to see they had more in common than Crowther assumed and than many scholarly accounts of African book history assume, particularly in the areas of the physicality of books, the modes of performance associated with books, and the interpersonal transactions that books facilitate.","[Ney, Stephen] Univ Sierra Leone, Freetown, Sierra Leone","Ney, S (corresponding author), Univ Sierra Leone, Freetown, Sierra Leone.",stephenjmney@gmail.com,,,,,,57,0,0,0,0,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1874-8937,1874-8945,,SOC SCI MISSION,Soc.

In our quantitative and explorative analysis of library catalogs from the National Library of Sweden and the National Library of Finland we identify the general trends in publishing, how book-printing has been affected by political events, and how printing developed at different paces in different parts of the realm. We have developed a new method for analyzing the totality of publishing through extensive data harmonization and comprehensive statistical analysis, and by treating library catalogs not as an endpoint of bibliographic research but as an inherently rich source of information. This facilitated the quantitative assessment of printing in the Swedish realm based on the metadata contained in library catalogs. Our data-driven approach to the transformation of public discourse demonstrates that whereas the amount of printed material grew steadily, political ruptures affected the development of printing. We also suggest that the culture of books and printing is best understood through the dynamics of competing intellectual hubs consisting of the university cities and the political center in Stockholm. This perspective further challenges the dominant, nationally delineated approach in book history.","[Tolonen, Mikko; Roivainen, Hege; Marjanen, Jani] Univ Helsinki, Dept Digital Humanities, POB 24,Unioninkatu 40, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Lahti, Leo] Univ Turku, Dept Math & Stat, Turku, Finland","Marjanen, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Digital Humanities, POB 24,Unioninkatu 40, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",jani.marjanen@helsinki.fi,"Lahti, Leo/G-3170-2010","Lahti, Leo/0000-0001-5537-637X; Tolonen, Mikko/0000-0003-2892-8911; Marjanen, Jani/0000-0002-3085-4862",,,,85,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0161-5440,1940-1906,,HIST METHOD,Hist.

This programmatic essay diagnoses the colonialist-Orientalist causes for this wild imbalance in comparative early modern Western intellectual and imperial historiography and outlines a philological way forward. Far from being evidence for the superstition of the Moslem natives, such manuals are an indispensable aperture onto precisely those processes-common to Islamdom and Christendom alike-by which we define Western early modernity: textualization, canonization, standardization, confessionalization, centralization, imperialization, bureaucratization, democratization, and mathematization. Yet they also record the religio-cultural and institutional divergences that so distinguish the Islamicate and especially Persianate experience of early modernity from the Latin Christianate.","[Melvin-Koushki, Matthew] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Melvin-Koushki, M (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",mmelvink@sc.edu,,,,,,44,2,2,0,0,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1874-7094,1874-7167,,J PERSIANATE STUD,J.

The relationships between these manuscript and printed texts and the debate as an event are described and assessed demonstrating the ways in which knowledge networks were constituted in Commonwealth England and how they contributed to changing definitions of political and ecclesial communities, the role of baptism as a sacrament in effecting transformation and staking out boundaries, and the formation of publics that were increasingly theologically informed and polemically engaged. Considering these richly documentary texts, which exist in a reciprocally generative relationship with a well-known historical event, as material embodiments that work rhetorically in the world enables a more robust account to be given of the people, texts, objects and networks that collaboratively redefined baptism, church polity, and their associated practices.","[Searle, Alison] Univ Leeds, Sch English, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","Searle, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch English, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.a.searle@leeds.ac.uk,,"Searle, Alison/0000-0002-9672-6353","Early Modern Conversions project at CRASSH, Cambridge","I am grateful to the Early Modern Conversions project for funding a Visiting Fellowship at CRASSH, Cambridge, which allowed me to undertake the research for this article.

The history of reading, and book history more generally, would benefit from an exploration of frameworks that extend beyond those of linear time and discrete periodization, and media and technology studies might help lead the way. This essay juxtaposes two annotations left in a set of cut-and-paste biblical harmonies made at the religious household of Little Gidding in the 1630s and 1640s. The first is a seventeenth-century note left by King Charles I; the second is a cut-up booklet made by an anonymous reader in the nineteenth century.

Examining the impact of the book through the lens of social and cultural change has vastly improved our knowledge of 17th-century Ireland. Indeed, the genre continues to expand. By focusing on the historian and antiquarian, Sir James Ware (1594-1666), this essay looks at potentially new ways book history can be analyzed. Three key aspects are investigated. First, it assesses Ware's scholarly achievements and suggests that his 11 publications were in some ways reflective of the evolving social dynamics in Stuart Ireland. Second, it analyzes his library and explores the reading habits of individuals who contacted Ware to borrow manuscripts and printed works. The items he loaned to both Catholics and Protestants are revealing, especially given the restrictive nature of institutional and private libraries. Third, it examines Ware's diverse network that crisscrossed ethnic, confessional, and political lines. In so doing, this essay challenges preconceived ideas that the various groupings in Ireland were diametrically opposed to supporting any kind of common endeavor.","[Empey, Mark] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland","Empey, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Hist, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",mark.empey@nuigalway.ie,,"Empey, Mark/0000-0003-0453-5750",,,,51,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1741-4113,,,LIT COMPASS,Lit.

Due to a series of decisions by scholars, editors, and grant agencies in the twentieth century, this letter is today best known in an English translation and within the frame provided by the popular Heath Anthology of American Literature. The appropriation of Otermin's letter by the discipline of American (US) literature, because its subject matter involves territory that more than two hundred years later became part of the United States, merits scrutiny. One approach, outlined here, is to follow the traces of the publication history of this document and to interrogate the unique story it tells about the contingencies of print on the borderlands.","[Bartosik-Velez, Elise] Dickinson Coll, Spanish, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA","Bartosik-Velez, E (corresponding author), Dickinson Coll, Spanish, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,UNIV COLORADO,BOULDER,"125 HELLEMS BLDG, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA",0013-8282,,,ENGL LANG NOTES,Engl.

However, the discovery of references to Porete in Francois de Belleforest's Grandes annales (1579) and Henri de Sponde's Annales ecclesiastici (1641) overturns this narrative and shows that these historians were responsible for reintroducing her story to the French public. Porete offered a powerful symbol that bolstered their vision of religion and state history, a vision that emphasized the purity of the Gallican Church and the role of the state in preserving its integrity in the face of heresy.

Writing within the gazetteer genre, Ph?m Than Duat engaged with foundational classical Chinese texts, recent Vietnamese works, and the Qing-era kaozheng movement of evidentiary scholarship. That he took himself to be participating in a literary culture that transcended Vietnam is clear from an analysis of his textual citations, as is his confidence in rejecting, reconfiguring, or adding to a transregional culture of knowledge. Ph?m Than Duat and others like him were autonomous contributors to a community of inquiry that transgressed political boundaries.

Whereas the reluctance of British companies to publish for Africa was in a large measure determined, albeit indirectly, by contemporary colonial policies and interests, the open, wholehearted encouragement of African writings in the 1960s and 1970s suggests a radical shift in the attitudes of British publishers. This shift arguably occurred at a time when the entire publishing industry in England witnessed a profound readjustment following the war years. Yet, more importantly, the full-scale 'decolonization' process in Africa, as in the rest of the empire, forced British publishers, such as HEB, to adopt new strategies to keep their businesses going in Africa.

Though scholars embrace its impact on the arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences, they seldom consider why the metaphor was so successful. Concentrating on the notebooks made and used by the schoolchildren of Enlightenment Scotland, this essay contends that the answer lies in the material and visual conditions that gave rise to the metaphor's usage. By the time students had finished school, they had learned to conceptualize the pages, the script, and the figures of their notebooks as indispensable learning tools that could be manipulated by scores of adaptable folding, writing, and drawing techniques. In this article, I reveal that historicizing the epistemology and manipulability of student manuscript culture makes it possible to see that the success of Locke's metaphor was founded on its appeal to everyday note-keeping activities performed by British schoolchildren.","[Eddy, Matthew Daniel] Max Planck Inst Hist Sci, Berlin, Germany","Eddy, MD (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Hist Sci, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,113,1,1,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-9371,1545-6986,,J BRIT STUD,J.

The contemporary challenge of research in children's literature is to combine a literary perspective with other angles: children's literature as media, as pedagogical artefact, and as raw material for children's play.

A couple of decades later, however, a more prominent feature of texts seems to be that they are permanently on the move: they circulate, have effects on other things, change and transform realities, and are at the same time themselves translated and modified. In the literature exploring the textuality of history, these dimensions have been under-theorized and often ignored. To meet this challenge, we need to develop concepts and approaches that enable us to place the mobility of texts as well as their mobilizing force at the center of our current historical concerns. In this article we will explore what the consequences of this move could be, and what resources are already at hand in different scholarly traditions. Exploring the entanglements between actor-network theory (ANT in the version of Bruno Latour), on the one hand, and literary criticism, linguistics, and book history, on the other, enables us to focus on how texts move and how they move others. We will proceed in this essay by identifying three decisive moments in twentieth-and twenty-first-century textual scholarship, often conceptualized as turns, which are linked to the works of three path-breaking authors and which at the same time represent three different stages or forms of textuality: the linguistic turn (Saussure), the turn to writing (Derrida), and the turn to print (Eisenstein). Our discussions of these three moments and forms of textuality aim at uncovering how they also represent seminal moments in Bruno Latour's development of the theoretical and methodological complex now referred to as ANT.","[Asdal, Kristin; Jordheim, Helge] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Asdal, K (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",,,,,,,44,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0018-2656,1468-2303,,HIST THEORY,Hist.

As part of a larger project on the history of the private library in China and through a reading of the available documentary evidence, this paper discusses the vicissitudes of one particular book collection, that of the Qi family of Shanyin, as items from this library made their way from Qi Biaojia's (1602-1645) Library of the Eight Principles of Book Acquisition in his Allegory Mountain into that of Zhao Yu (1689-1747) in Hangzhou, his Little Mountain Hall in the Garden of the Spring Grasses. In doing so, I propose a reading of the private libraries and gardens of the Qing dynasty (1368-1644) as critical 'contact zones' wherein the newly installed (and foreign) ruling Manchu elite sought to adopt and appropriate Han literary and artistic culture, and where, occasionally, as in this case, the Han Chinese elite resisted such processes. Methodologically, I will seek to bring into dialogue the disciplines of book history and garden history.","[Campbell, Duncan M.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Languages & Cultures, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand","Campbell, DM (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Languages & Cultures, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",duncan.campbell@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,47,0,0,1,11,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0967-3407,1752-7023,,ENVIRON HIST-UK,Env.

The essay is in two parts: first, it addresses current ways of thinking about the relationship between Shakespeare and the history of the book, including questions of Shakespearean authorship and ownership; then it uses by Arthur Phillips (2011) as a case study of how a contemporary novel explores these questions creatively. Connecting this case study with current research in early modern bibliography, textual studies and authorship studies should lead to an improved sense not only of the kind of writer that Shakespeare was, but also of the ways in which the possible-world scenarios of fiction can illuminate the limits of our understanding.

The second part of this paper highlights three aspects by means of which the integration of the system becomes effective in the chronicle, namely: the logic of page composition, the tensions arising in the xylographic representations between the obedience to the iconographic tradition and the expectation of viewing what it refers to, as well as the functions that one can assign to the visual information in the printed material.","[Araujo, Andre de Melo] Univ Brasilia, Hist Moderna, Brasilia, DF, Brazil","Araujo, AD (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Dept Hist, Campus Univ Darcy Ribeiro, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",andre_meloaraujo@yahoo.com.br,,"Araujo, Andre de Melo/0000-0002-8483-8235",,,,49,0,0,0,0,"UNIV SAO PAULO, FAC FILOSOFIA LETRAS & CIENCIAS HUMANAS",SAO PAULO,"AV PROFESSOR LUCIANO GUALBERTO 315, BUTANTA, SAO PAULO, SP 05508-010, BRAZIL",0034-8309,2316-9141,,REV HIST-SAO PAULO,Rev.

Based on certain editions of this work, modern scholars have assumed that this text is composed of recipes collected from itinerant healers, and that it was its author's intention to transmit folk healing practices through the printed word. The original manuscript that Zhao Xuemin compiled probably never appeared in print, however, whereas the extant editions of this text found numerous new editions and re-printings. Focusing on several manuscripts and printed editions of the Chuanya which emerged between the late Qing and Republican period, this article traces the processes through which various different agents created and recreated the Chuanya. In contrast to past studies where the connection between the Chuanya and popular healing is taken for granted, I argue that any conclusion should primarily take into account the various editions of this work. By the case study of this text, I hope to clarify a broader dimension around the authorship of printed medical books in late imperial China and challenge the assumption that we can understand them outside the context of their edition and publication.","[Junqueira, Luis Fernando Bernardi] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Junqueira, LFB (corresponding author), Room 07,13-F,Block B,1 Po Man St, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",youle.junqueira@gmail.com,"Junqueira, Luis Fernando Bernardi/W-4700-2017","Junqueira, Luis Fernando Bernardi/0000-0002-9085-8689",,,,83,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0254-9948,2057-1690,,MONUM SER-J ORIENT S,Monum.

J,"Barnett, T",,,,"Barnett, Tully",,,Distributed reading: Literary reading in diverse environments,DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DIGITIZATION,"Reading has always been a contentious and political practice, but this is heightened in the contemporary moment both because of the way the environments in which we read are changing so radically. For Katherine Hayles reading is a powerful technology for reconfiguring activity patterns in the brain [Hayles 2010, 193], a view representative of attempts to connect the new neuroscience of reading with age old practices of literary endeavour. For Sven Birkerts, however, the Internet and the novel are opposites [Birkerts 2010], a view that suggests that a hierarchy of reading that locks digital readers out of higher order thinking and literary experience. Meanwhile, Anne Mangen finds that electronic reading environments negatively affect emotional aspects of reading [Mangen 2016]. But these approaches tend to understand reading as something static that occurs in one space or another. However, in practice our reading is increasingly distributed. Reading can occur in multiple formats, across multiple platforms for the one text or reading experience. A novel begun in print can be read online in a born-digital format and concluded in a scanned digital format, for example. These journeys across platform require deeper investigation. If we think of the printed book as an interface between two orders of thinking, we need to consider how the experience of reading a digitized version of a formerly printed and bound book alters literary reception and student experience. How does the experience of reading across different technological platforms change the reader's relationship to the content? As more and more electronic reading platforms take on the physical attributes of material reading experiences either by retaining material traces or by emulating them, we might question what experience How do the material traces left on digitised works impact the reading process for reading in literary studies? The lively discourse surrounding Google Books and the human breaches of the material into the immaterial, as the work crosses the borders of formats and interfaces, raises valuable questions about the future of the book, reading in the twenty-first century, and the long and formidable shadow that centuries of material text production casts over Google Books' electronic utopia. This paper uses both book history and new media interface theory to consider the multitude of diverse experiences that is literary reading across different platforms in and out of the classroom and to consider whether distracted reading can be better understood as distributed reading. It considers critical infrastructure studies as a useful framework through which to think about reading in the digital age.","[Barnett, Tully] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Barnett, T (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",tully_._barnett_@_flinders_._edu_._au,,,,,,60,0,0,2,4,ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS,BOSTON,"SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA",1938-4122,,,DIGIT HUMANITIES Q,DIGIT.

People who are drawn to print books often find that digital surrogates 'lack feeling' (Piper, 2012). Digitized texts preserve linguistic content of print works but not their many meaningful physical features that fundamentally shape interpretation (McGann, 1991) and contain valuable historical traces of print technologies, markets, and readerly interactions (Stauffer, 2012). Changing how we physically interact with texts also changes how we sense and make sense of them. How can we harness the potential of digital media to better represent and analyze print collections? How can we accentuate their unique historic, aesthetic, and material qualities while also allowing rich linking supported by computer-assisted content analyses? How can design critically engage with the sensory differences between reading print materials and on-screen reading in order to promote different modes of meaningful textual engagement? Addressing these questions, we introduce synesthetic visualization as a speculative approach to creating digital on-screen and tangible representations of print collections that translate - not replicate - sensory experiences of interacting with print collections by coupling visual representations with cues for other sensory modalities (e.g, sonic, tactile) that are routinely engaged by print texts. Drawing insights from aesthetic theory, book history, reception studies, literary studies, information visualization, human computer interaction (HCI), and digital arts, we propose possible ways to experiment with digital on-screen and tangible representations of print collections that explicitly aim to translate - not replicate - sensory and sense-making experiences inherent in interacting with print collections. We illustrate this through our own ongoing work with the Bob Gibson Anthologies of Speculative Fiction, unique hand-crafted booklets composed of science-fictional items culled from popular periodicals published between 1844 and 1992.","[Forlini, Stefania; Brosz, John] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Hinrichs, Uta] St Andrews Univ, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland","Forlini, S (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.",sforlini@ucalgary.ca,"Brosz, John/P-8467-2015; Hinrichs, Uta/X-1644-2019","Brosz, John/0000-0002-4123-9240; Hinrichs, Uta/0000-0001-7494-0941",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Mellon Foundation,Research presented in this article was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Mellon Foundation.

While recent histories of reading situate the origins of that love in an eighteenth-century culture of sensibility, we show that the responses to books developed by some Shakespearean characters already adumbrate specific varieties of modern book love.

Unfortunately this important voice of the formerly colonised people of Somalia in the land of their former colonial masters has largely been lost. In this article I show that Farah's work has had limited influence in Italy because of a set of systemic economic and ideological pressures that restricted the publication and reception of his work in an Italy that was politically polarised in its opinion of the Siad Barre regime. Also examined in this article is the influence of the awarding of prestigious literary prizes to Farah and the effect this had of boosting the value of his later work to mainstream Italian publishers as well as the commoditisation of Farah's works within the framework of specific practices associated with the marketing of African fiction in the West and in Italy.,"[Fotheringham, Christopher] Univ Witwatersrand, Translat Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa","Fotheringham, C (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Translat Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa.",Christopher.fotheringham@wits.ac.za,,"Fotheringham, Christopher/0000-0003-4695-2800",,,,51,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0002-0184,1469-2872,,AFR STUD-UK,Afr.

Following baptism, he took up the post of Hebrew instructor at Harvard, which he held until retiring forty years later. A source of fascination for Puritans of his own time as for modern historians, Monis is perhaps best known for his grammar of the Hebrew language. Printed in 1735, it was the very first of its kind in the colonies. The intensive hybridity of this book is a material instantiation of Monis's struggle to repackage his competence in Hebrew grammar and rabbinics as a marketable commodity for his Anglophone Puritan readers and their shifting missionary aspirations. Situated at the intersection of book history, poetics, and translation studies, the present article reads Monis's linguistic hybridity alongside earlier efforts to transliterate Algonquin languages of colonial New England as a first step toward evangelical translations such as the Eliot Indian Bible of 1663. Here, I argue that the visual poetics of Monis's transliteration system conspire with the confessional politics of his translations-which foreignize Christian prayer as much as they Christianize Hebrew-to disclose the failure of evangelizing translation as a spiritual exercise in early colonial America.","[Wamsley, Rachel] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Wamsley, R (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.",,,,,,,58,0,0,0,0,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",0271-9274,1948-5077,,STUD AM JEW LIT,Stud.

Noting the emphasis that Darnton's circuit places on the book as a cultural object, Beins considers what a circuit might look like that centers feminist periodicals. As print products, feminist periodicals fissure the apparent wholeness of the textual object. As products of feminist praxis, they push us to look at the politics of publishing and to consider why and how people and processes shape a text's life cycle. Feminist periodicals, especially newsletters and newspapers, disrupt the linear chronology and clear, distinct roles suggested by a circuit. To deal with the messiness and non-linearity of these print products, Beins offers the publishing assemblage as a concept that can honor the idiosyncratic nature of feminist periodicals. Though grounded in readings of feminist periodicals, Beins ultimately offers the publishing assemblage as a methodology for book history that can allow researchers to describe the myriad practices associated with print, including the seemingly infinite practices of writing, editing, publishing, and reading.","[Beins, Agatha] Texas Womans Univ, Dept Multicultural Womens & Gender Studies, Denton, TX 76204 USA","Beins, A (corresponding author), Texas Womans Univ, Dept Multicultural Womens & Gender Studies, Denton, TX 76204 USA.",abeins@twu.edu,,,,,,76,0,0,0,0,OHIO STATE UNIV PRESS,COLUMBUS,"1050 CARMACK RD, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA",1054-7479,1548-4238,,AM PERIOD,Am.

Mary Anne Sadlier (1820-1903) is mostly known as a prolific Irish-American author of Catholic, immigrant and patriotic novels. Regarded today as one of the most influential writers of the Famine generation, she emigrated from Ireland to North America, and married into a successful Catholic publishing family, D. & J. Sadlier. This essay offers a departure from the existing literature. Despite the fact that she translated and edited numerous works from the French, Sadlier's translations remain largely unexplored in the critical literature. Religion, morality and education were the driving force behind her translations, and her work illustrates the growth of a Catholic literature in English in the constructive period of both the Irish and the American Catholic Church. Moreover, the example of a woman who was in her day successful outside the domestic arena as a writer-translator-editor-publisher invites us to touch on issues of social and cultural authority for women at the time. Sadlier's story is symptomatic of a wider and emergent Catholic transnational culture - or translocal culture - in the nineteenth century. Mobility and translation, therefore, challenge fixed notions of identity and nationality. Beyond reflecting the hyphenated Irish-American experience, Mary Anne Sadlier's life and work provide us with a sound example of the ways in which translation contributed to extending and multiplying trans-Atlantic connections.",,,michele.milan2@mail.dcu.ie,,,,,,46,2,2,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1478-8810,1740-4649,,ATL STUD-GLOB CURR,Atl.

This private space emphasised the traditional hierarchies of political and legal order: Women's work that took place within the printing house thus fell into the traditional role of household labours. This erasure of labour is one that foregrounds the erasure of women's writing from history; women who worked in essence as publishers, as printers and booksellers, are very clearly present in the historical records but invisible in our narratives of book history. How did this erasure happen, and why is their presence, and work, overlooked? If we consider the language of space in theory and reread Moxon's Mechanickal Exercises closely, we see the ways in which the ideas of space itself can be implicitly gendered, and how this might shape our idea of the printing house.","[Coker, Cait] Texas A&M Univ, Boulder, CO 80303 USA","Coker, C (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",cait.coker@gmail.com,,,,,,38,2,2,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-117X,2050-4616,,SEVENTEENTH CENT,Seventeenth Century,,2018,33,3,,,,,323,336,,10.1080/0268117X.2017.1340850,,,14,Medieval & Renaissance Studies,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,GI8OT,WOS:000434785000004,,,,,2020-08-21,

After exclusion of incomplete or doubtful data, 1,087 entries were selected for statistical analysis, in order to attempt to reveal overall trends as well as some of the main factors influencing prices of. 'first-hand' (i.e., not second-hand), unbound books. These factors include the year of publication, the 'age' of editions, bibliographical format and use of any specific founts, such as Hebrew and Greek. Our analysis shows that prices of the majority of the editions mentioned more than once across different catalogues remained stable. In 1.3% of the cases for which enough data is present, prices varied. The results of this survey help us to understand something about the general price levels of books in Paris in this period, which in turn will help us develop a deeper understanding of the hook trade on a wider scale in both time and space.","[Proot, Goran] Univ Udine, Udine, Italy","Proot, G (corresponding author), Univ Udine, Udine, Italy.",,,,European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programmeEuropean Research Council (ERC) [694476],This contribution springs from research founded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement no 694476).,,11,0,0,0,0,"UNIV STUDI FIRENZE, DIPT STUDI MEDIOEVO & RINASCIMENTO",FLORENCE,"PIAZZA BRUNELLESCHI 3-4, FLORENCE, 50121, ITALY",2038-5366,2038-1026,,JLIS.IT,JLIS.it,,2018,9,2,,,,,192,221,,10.4403/jlis.it-12459,,,30,Information Science & Library Science,Information Science & Library Science,GG7EV,WOS:000432862200011,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-08-21,

It has been translated into several languages, including English, French and German. In this article, I present a reading of the multiple stagings of Mofolo's novel by assessing the changes in the material and paratextual production of the text. By following the fortunes of Mofolo's Chaka, I elucidate the various shapes it has taken and meanings it has accrued on its journey through time and space. Four distinct lineages of Mofolo's Chaka are identified: the mission text, the English colonial text, the French colonial production and the post-colonial text; thus tracing the historical passage of an African-authored text through colonial, apartheid, post-colonial and post-apartheid contexts. The article sheds light on the particular ways in which the novel and African literature more generally have been made to signify, what interpretive frames have been privileged, and what kinds of genre categorisation have predominated. In advancing the notion of 'history by paratext', I also argue for the shifting paratext as an important historical index of the tensions, contradictions and inconsistencies of particular historical contexts.","[Sandwith, Corinne] Univ Pretoria, Dept English, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa","Sandwith, C (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept English, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.",corinne.sandwith@up.ac.za,,,,,,79,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7070,1465-3893,,J S AFR STUD,J.

He also orchestrated the printing of catalogues and journals in his capacity as library assistant to the British Museum and the India Office Library. He even set up his own press to print a newspaper in order to disseminate knowledge of East Asia to a broader readership.

They each deal with a single contemporary event: a peace treaty, the imperial election of Charles V and the siege of Rhodes by the Ottomans. As such, they belong to a larger corpus of texts dealing with the news, but they have a different status from the majority of them, as topical poetic pieces that presented both news and Ladam's own commentary. Analysing the books in which these poems were printed allows us to study the communication strategies of their author and his publishers, and their possible impact on the audiences they addressed. Seen in this light, Ladam's poetry and the context of its publication offers intriguing evidence of how news was interpreted and celebrated in the early sixteenth century.","[Laveant, Katell] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Walsby, Malcolm] Univ Rennes, Rennes, France","Laveant, K (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",k.laveant@uu.nl; malcolm.walsby@gmail.com,,"Walsby, Malcolm/0000-0001-8873-9042",,,,34,0,0,0,0,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0014-9527,1570-0690,,QUAERENDO,Quaerendo,,2018,48,1,,,,,17,38,,10.1163/15700690-12341395,,,22,Literature,Literature,GA7OS,WOS:000428526400002,,,,,2020-08-21,

Drawing on considerations of material culture, comparative evidence, and insights from the field of book history, I suggest that the Jeremiah traditions existed in the early Persian period as an only partially ordered collection rather than a linear book. Rather than one version being original and the other an editorial rearrangement, both the LXX and the MT represent independent organizations of this collection.","[Mastnjak, Nathan] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Mastnjak, N (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,37,1,1,0,0,CATHOLIC BIBLICAL ASSOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"CATHOLIC UNIV AMERICA, 620 MICHIGAN AVE, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20064 USA",0008-7912,2163-2529,,CATH BIBLICAL QUART,Cathol.

In about 1662, the duke purchased an unusual 1596 print in Latin script of a religious work offered to him as Tractatus de contemptu mundi in lingua Japonica. It was included in the ethica and not, as one would expect, in the theologica section of his collection, and this may be one of the reasons why the Jesuit print has not been listed in the currently most complete bibliography of prints of the Japanese Jesuit mission press compiled in 1940 by Johannes Laures, S.J., and later supplemented. Apart from the Augusta print only two other prints seemed to have survived.

Longfellow's correspondence with publishers John Walker, George Routledge, and David Bogue and Bogue's illustrated editions of Evangeline and Hyperion reveal that British reprints manifested overlapping discourses of authorization and value. Publishers used the materiality of their texts to legitimize their reprinting but also to champion Longfellow's poetry, American letters more broadly, and Longfellow's vision of a cosmopolitan American literature. The essay then traces this dialogue between British books and the emergence of American literature in Longfellow's The Courtship of Miles Standish, in which transatlantic circulation and British books are integral to the founding of the United States and American writing. Ultimately, this essay repositions British reprints as complex acts of reception that intervened in debates over the nature of American literature, and it argues for a recentering of US literary history around material transatlantic exchange.","[McGettigan, Katie] Royal Holloway Univ London, Amer Literature, London, England","McGettigan, K (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Amer Literature, London, England.",,,"McGettigan, Katie/0000-0002-8259-4126",Leverhulme Trust Early Career FellowshipLeverhulme Trust,"A version of this essay was presented at the American Studies Research Seminar at the University of East Anglia, and I am grateful for the feedback I received on that occasion.

J,"Mincer, RZ",,,,"Mincer, Rachel Zohn",,,The Increasing Reliance on Ritual Handbooks in Pre-Print Era Ashkenaz,JEWISH HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ashkenaz; Late medieval; Minhagim book; Communal functionary; Book history,,"Handbooks devoted to a single area of ritual practice figure prominently among the works produced by German Jews from the thirteenth century to the fifteenth. These handbooks include minhagim books intended primarily as liturgical guides for cantors and manuals for other types of communal functionaries, such as scribes and ritual slaughterers. Historians typically associate minhagim books with the post-Black Death period and the desire to provide guidance during a time of decline for German Jewry. Similarly, the flourishing of halakhic manuals is considered a fourteenth-century phenomenon, a result of the rabbinate's professionalization. However, these explanations are insufficient since both genres emerged earlier. This article links the production of ritual handbooks to two trends: geographic mobility and a more text-oriented culture. Between the thirteenth century and the fifteenth, major changes in German Jewish settlement patterns disrupted the transmission of ritual practice and led to a need for practical guides. The proliferation of ritual handbooks was also related to the increase in Ashkenazic society-as in medieval Europe generally-in the production of written texts. These texts included liturgical genres and practical halakhic works, some of which served as sources for the handbooks. However, the handbooks tend to be more accessible than their predecessors and to include more practical details. The proliferation of late medieval ritual handbooks demonstrates that changes typically associated with the advent of print, including a growing reliance on written sources for practical information and a move toward the standardization of ritual practice, began to emerge in earlier centuries.","[Mincer, Rachel Zohn] Jewish Theol Seminary, New York, NY 10027 USA","Mincer, RZ (corresponding author), Jewish Theol Seminary, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rzohn.mincer@gmail.com,,,,,,90,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0334-701X,1572-8579,,JEW HIST,Jew.

I argue that these origins influenced Middle Eastern book history insofar as it took the topic of printing as its main focus. However, an unevenness characterized this focus since European printing became commonplace from the early sixteenth century onwards, whereas printing in the Middle East took off during the nineteenth century. The 400years that separated these phenomena marked the rise of modern Europe, which print was considered to have helped advance. These years were also interpreted as representing the decline of the Islamicate world until it modernized along a Western model, including its widespread adoption of print. Focusing largely on scholarship written in English, I summarize the effects that such thinking has had in shaping Middle Eastern book history, and then conclude with my sense of the state of current research.","[Schwartz, Kathryn A.] Inst Adv Study Toulouse, Toulouse, France","Schwartz, KA (corresponding author), Inst Adv Study Toulouse, Toulouse, France.",kaschwartz@gmail.com,,,ANR - LabexFrench National Research Agency (ANR),Support through the ANR - Labex is gratefully acknowledged.,,115,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1478-0542,,,HISTORY COMPASS,History Compass,DEC,2017,15,12,,,,,,,e12434,10.1111/hic3.12434,,,12,History,History,FQ3OB,WOS:000418265400005,,,,,2020-08-21,

The project focuses on three contexts in which children and adults interact with books: the home, the school and the book market. Theoretical inspirations have been drawn from book history, children's literature studies and childhood studies, including the concept of agency. A major database maps Danish books aimed at children 1750-1850, making it possible to trace the popularity of titles through reprints and new editions and to follow specific actors (authors, illustrators, printers and so on). Ego-documents by children - for example, letters written by Ida Thiele (1830-1862) - are analysed as sources of information on children's own experiences with books, their use of different media and their interaction with peers, relatives and teachers in relation to reading and books. Finally, we demonstrate how significant changes in form, content and the materiality of books for children can be captured, when following specific books such as E. Munthe's books on history and geography around the communication circuit. The article concludes that a combination of different cross-disciplinary methodologies is essential in a history of children's literature with children at its centre.","[Appel, Charlotte] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Christensen, Nina] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Childrens Literature & Media, Aarhus, Denmark","Appel, C (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.",,,,Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF),"The project 'Children and books - enterprises and encounters.

J,"Sayre, GM",,,,"Sayre, Gordon M.",,,The Alexandrian Library of Life A Flawed Metaphor for Biodiversity,ENVIRONMENTAL HUMANITIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,species extinction; biodiversity; information science; genomics; classics; book history; library studies,BOOK,"In the last quarter-century many scientific, environmental, and popular publications have used a metaphor comparing species extinction and the loss of biodiversity in the modern era to the destruction of the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt more than 1,500 years ago. The rhetorical figure is characteristic of the environmental humanities, for it invokes the value of cultural and literary treasures to reinforce the importance of biological diversity. This article traces the origins of the metaphor to related figures of The Book of Life and to the figure of genetic information as a textual code. The Alexandrian Library of Life caught hold in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when concern about biodiversity and the destruction of tropical rainforests coincided with developments in gene sequencing, the Human Genome Project, and the growth of Internet communications and electronic library collections. Scientists and environmentalists at that time sensed both the promise of unprecedented access to bio-information and the threat of lost knowledge through species extinction. The popularity of the metaphor conceals several weaknesses, however. Living species, even using the methods of gene sequencing, cannot be archived or copied like texts, and the impulse to do so reflects imperialist efforts to appropriate and control knowledge, as several empires attempted to do at Alexandria during the library's long history. The metaphor of a species as a book, represented in the library by one specimen or copy, obscures the fact that the Alexandrian library consisted of manuscripts, not print books. In essence, species may be more like manuscripts than books after all.","[Sayre, Gordon M.] Univ Oregon, Dept English, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Sayre, GM (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept English, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,,,,,,44,1,1,0,1,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",2201-1919,,,ENVIRON HUMANITIES,Environ.

Although the objective of the first fashion magazines was to promote Paris fashion and French cultural dominance throughout the world, they gradually became a medium for cultural transfers in different directions. Fashion magazines are endowed with a cultural function and economic value and, more so than the book, are the product of artistic, graphic and intellectial processes that occur in different spaces. This paper therefore proposes a methodology to examine how the transfer, adaptation and consolidation of an abstract concept - fashion - materialises in the printed media, having as its point of departure Barthes' written-garment and image-clothing in order to create a typology for the variety of textual and pictorial materials that are found in a fashion magazine.","[Suriani Da Silva, Ana Claudia] UCL, Brazilian Studies, London, England; [Suriani Da Silva, Ana Claudia] Univ Oxford, Letras Modernas, Oxford, England","Da Silva, ACS (corresponding author), UCL, Brazilian Studies, London, England.; Da Silva, ACS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Letras Modernas, Oxford, England.",a.surianidasilva@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,32,0,0,0,1,ASSOC BRASILEIRA ESTUDOS & PESQUISAS MODA,SAO PAULO,"RUA CARDOSO ALMEIDA, 788CONJ 144, SAO PAULO, CEP05013-001, BRAZIL",2358-0003,1982-0313,,DOBRAS,dObras,NOV,2017,10,22,,,,,178,201,,,,,24,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,FQ1QY,WOS:000418133900012,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-08-21,

The open nature of serialisation in South Asia, in which novels were not planned in advance but rather could develop and change while in progress, meant that serialised versions of novels were often more experimental than their later book editions. In this article, I use the pioneering Urdu novel Fasna-e Azd (1878-83) as a case study to examine serialisation's effects on the emerging novel genre in the late nineteenth-century South Asia. By comparing the serial version and later book editions, I show that Fasna-e Azd underwent a fundamental transformation from serial to book, changing from a set of satirical sketches critical of Westernisation, to a pro-colonial novel. The protagonist Azad's shift from a picaresque anti-hero to a proto-nationalist hero reflected the changing nature of respectability, what in Urdu was called sharafat, in the late nineteenth-century South Asia. Finally, I suggest that Fasna-e Azd's evolution from serial to book anticipated the turn in South Asian literature from satire towards nationalist and prescriptive discourse, reflecting the broad movement from ideological and narratological openness to closedness in the twentieth century.","[Dubrow, Jennifer] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Dubrow, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,,,,51,3,2,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD,NEW DELHI,"B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA",0019-4646,0973-0893,,INDIAN ECON SOC HIST,Indian Econ.

The dendrochronological reference shows that the oak wood originates from East Pomerania-Gdansk region. The intriguing fact is that the book was not printed until 1879 in Moscow. The seemingly contradictory dates and locations can be explained by the adventurous history of the Old Believers sects in Russia. The Old Believers were suppressed during the Russian Orthodox Church reforms between 1652 and 1666 and many of them escaped to remote marginal areas of the empire or emigrated, e.g. to Rzeczpospolita. Due to lively communication between the Old Believers' congregations, their literature moved from country to country. In this case, a newer book of the Old Believers was bound with old wooden covers from Poland.","[Laanelaid, Alar] Univ Tartu, Landscape Ecol, Tartu, Estonia; [Wazny, Tomasz] Univ Arizona, Tree Ring Res Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Wazny, Tomasz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Fine Arts, Torun, Poland","Laanelaid, A (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Landscape Ecol, Tartu, Estonia.",,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,UNIV TARTU PRESS,TARTU,"1 W STRUVE ST, TARTU, 50091, ESTONIA",1736-8812,2346-5581,,BALT J HIST,Balt.

Its intention is to insert these British military publications into their contemporary publishing landscape and consequently to make a contribution to the field of book history. It will be argued that the narrative accounts in the books and journal articles were indicative of both the geographical dispersion and of the interconnectedness of colonial knowledge. From this perspective, some of the publications portrayed a transnational, horizontal movement between colonies. But there were other routes: many publications demonstrated a more predictable north-south, vertical course which was evident in the campaign narratives printed in the influential metropolitan centre of London. The readership, that is the Warnerian audience, spanned both the colonies and the metropole, as the discussion on the commentary proffered by professional journal reviewers demonstrates. In an attempt to give substance to these textual confluences, the article provides a limited discussion of Harriet Ward's and Edward Elers Napier's narratives concerning the Cape and the 7th Frontier War. Their texts demonstrate how the global mesh of texts rematerialized and reconfigured itself in an array of publications during the 1840s and 1850s. Furthermore, it will be suggested that the integration of texts within the nineteenth-century knowledge and power nexus helped to shape metropolitan notions of the Xhosa and to delineate colonial relations with the Xhosa.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,"RHODES UNIV, INST STUDY ENGLISH AFRICA",EAST CAPE,"PO BOX 94 GRAHAMSTOWN, EAST CAPE, 6140, SOUTH AFRICA",0376-8902,2071-7474,,ENGL AFR,Engl.

At present, there were not found any research works on history of Old Believers book bindings in Siberia, but there are a number of works that illuminate some aspects of the subject. These works can be divided into following groups: - Encyclopedic, dictionaries and reference books. The group includes materials in dictionaries and reference books on bookbinding and restoration, which are presented in different forms, as well as encyclopedias. - Proceedings, devoted to the book history as the whole. - Research and published sources about bookbinding. The group can be divided into two categories that are the texts of the medieval bookbinders, which represent sources of bookbinding and the study of bookbinding proper. - Practical guidance on restoration and bookbinding. A group of works, dedicated on regional issues directly, can be also selected; these works are necessary for the reconstruction of the historical context of the study. Works of the category are necessary for reconstruction of historical context of old-believer's bookbinding history; they allow to establish the names of owners of book collections as well. - Catalogs of the Research Library of Tomsk State University and Tomsk Museum of Local History. Viewing of the catalogues shown, that bookbinders were described in very general terms, because the task was not intended. Thus, historiography on the subject is not very extensive, but varied. Partly mentioned publications refer to both categories of sources (usually secondary) for this study and to historiography as such. There are a number of works on the history of the book, on the history of binding and practical guidance on restoration and on the history of Tomsk Old Believers, but the individual works on the Old Believers book binding, could not be found at the moment. Collections under study (Research Library of Tomsk State University and Tomsk Museum of Local History) also have not been explored from this point of view; there are only brief descriptions of the bindings of manuscripts as a part of the catalog of Slavic-Russian manuscripts of the Scientific Library of Tomsk State University and the library catalog Nifantov's family (Tomsk Museum of Local History).","[Logunova, Ekaterina A.] Natl Res Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia","Logunova, EA (corresponding author), Natl Res Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia.",logunova-kate@mail.ru,"Logunova, Ekaterina/T-3330-2017",,,,,32,0,0,0,0,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2222-0836,2311-3685,,VESTN TOMSK GOS U KU,Vestn.

Yet many of these manuscripts are nonetheless variously connected with printed books: some were sewn into printed books as addenda. Because some manuscripts could not be published, their texts reached readers as manuscript publications. Yet other nineteenth-century manuscript texts published as manuscripts reproduced popular printed books that had come out in the Baroque period but could not be republished because of Enlightenment disapproval. This article explores the ways both media coexisted, with an emphasis on Slovenian letters in the early modern age, highlighting several special features of the manuscript medium. A manuscript enabled a scribe or a writer to considerably adapt its text not only to his linguistic idiom, but also to adapt, vary, and shorten a text, adding elements of oral tradition, according to his affinities and the needs of the local social context. He thus combined textual transmission of a manuscript (Textuberlieferung) with authorial creativity in a new text. During Slovenian letters' difficult and long transitional period from manuscript to the medium of the printed book, which lasted from the sixteenth until the middle of the nineteenth century, the manuscript was a medium that facilitated synthesis of copying texts and modifying and creating them.","[Ogrin, Matija] ZRC SAZU, Inst Slovensko Literaturo & Literarne Vede, Novi Trg 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Ogrin, M (corresponding author), ZRC SAZU, Inst Slovensko Literaturo & Literarne Vede, Novi Trg 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",matija.ogrin@zrc-sazu.si,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,SLOVENE COMPARATIVE LITERATURE ASSOC,LJUBLJANA,"ASKERCEVA 2, LJUBLJANA, 1000, SLOVENIA",0351-1189,,,PRIM KNJIZEV,Prim.

Book history always had a close - if never precisely articulated - relationship with New Historicism, but in recent years, I argue, as the influence of the latter has waned in English studies, book history has become a crucible of alternative historicisms in part because it is the subfield that deals most immediately and reflexively with the status of texts as historical evidence. Perhaps paradoxically, I also suggest, book history is by its nature a demilitarized zone, protected from the extremes of presentism and pastism, aestheticism and contextualism, critique and affective attachment, while freer than many subfields to absorb what is best in these conflicting intellectual campaigns. I organize my account in three section headings that reflect what I see as the prevailing currents in Shakespeare and book history at present: the plurality of context, reading at scale, and beyond materiality.","[Knight, Jeffrey Todd] Univ Washington, English, Box 354330, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Knight, Jeffrey Todd] Univ Washington, Textual Studies Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Knight, JT (corresponding author), Univ Washington, English, Box 354330, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jtknight@uw.edu,,,,,,79,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1741-4113,,,LIT COMPASS,Lit.

The fruitfulness and longevity of Lukacs' approach can to a large extent be traced back to his creative and bold attempt to articulate distinct interpretations of the process of modernization within a theoretical framework inspired, for the most part, by Karl Marx's analysis of commodity fetishism. It has been noted many times that Max Weber's approach to the connection between Western rationalism and modern capitalism plays a crucial role in Lukacs' essay, as does Georg Simmel's enquiry into the cultural significance of the modern monetary economy. This article intends to explore the tensions that arise out of such a challenging endeavour by way of an imaginary dialogue between Weber and Simmel, taking place shortly after the publication of History and Class Consciousness. This allows us not only to reflect on some of the intricacies of Lukacs' seminal essay but also to delve into fundamental contrasts between the Simmelian and Weberian approaches to social reality and modernity.","[Bueno, Arthur] Univ Erfurt, Max Weber Ctr Adv Cultural & Social Studies, Erfurt, Germany; [Teixeira, Mariana] Brazilian Ctr Anal & Planning, Rua Morgado de Mateus 615, BR-05353030 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Teixeira, M (corresponding author), Brazilian Ctr Anal & Planning, Rua Morgado de Mateus 615, BR-05353030 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",mariana.on.teixeira@gmail.com,"Bueno, Arthur/AAH-3617-2020",,,,,42,1,1,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1468-795X,1741-2897,,J CLASS SOCIOL,J.

Despite issues in data quality, the bibliography-based quantitative approach opens an avenue for investigating systematically how books were produced, translated and published, where they were distributed, and who was reading them.","[Zhou, Xiaoyan] Beihang Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Sanjun] Beijing Foreign Studies Univ, Sch English & Int Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China","Sun, SJ (corresponding author), Beijing Foreign Studies Univ, Sch English & Int Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",sunsanjun@gmail.com,,"Sun, Sanjun/0000-0002-4020-8418","SRF for ROCS, SEMScientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015JJ003]; Beijing Foreign Studies University [2016JT004]","This work was supported by SRF for ROCS, SEM, by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 2015JJ003], and by the Young Faculty Research Fund of Beijing Foreign Studies University [grant number 2016JT004].",,73,5,4,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0907-676X,1747-6623,,PERSPECT STUD TRANSL,Perspect.-Stud.

I use the constituent texts of the industry to demonstrate that it developed upon the speculative model of commissioning, whereby individuals paid printers to produce particular works of their choosing. Commissioning indicates that Egyptian private printing grew from local traditions for producing handwritten texts. Nevertheless, print commissioning differed from manuscript commissioning by requiring individuals to assume great financial risk. I explore the nature and implications of this divergence through a treatise published in 1871 by Musa Kastali, a particularly prolific printer who helped to professionalize Cairene printing. Musa's treatise details his legal battle with a famous Azhari commissioner, and is unique for describing a printer's business practices. It demonstrates the importance of situating printings within their socioeconomic contexts in addition to their intellectual ones, a task which cannot be done without an appreciation for the functioning of the printing industry at a local level.","[Schwartz, Kathryn A.] Harvard Univ, Digital Lib Eastern Mediterranean, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Schwartz, KA (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Digital Lib Eastern Mediterranean, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kaschwartz@gmail.com,,,,,,92,6,6,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0020-7438,1471-6380,,INT J MIDDLE E STUD,Int.

The article draws on author's database dating from 2008. The case-study of the Streshnevs family (17th century) has shown that even isolated records contain unique information on the fates of the family members. Thus, taken together, the data provides important information on the genesis of social groups and allows study the fates of book collections. This subject-matter is traced in this case-study of two Perm enterpriser families: the Smyshlyaevs and the clan of Ostanin-Lunegov-Rzhevins. The apostils allow trace five generations of the families and make genealogical tables. The study establishes that two families changed their social status several times throughout the century. Smyshlyaevs began as priests to rise to noblility, members of the Ostanin-Lunegov-Rzhevins clan rose from peasants to petty bourgeoisie and merchants. Moreover, apostils and genealogical tables contribute important data to the book history of the region. It is shown that apostils serve as legal document recording the owner's social status and their connection with the book (inheritance, purchase, etc.). Books that contain apostils of the Ostanin-Lunegov-Rzhevins clan members allow identify them as old believers.","[Bogdanov, V.

J,"Braida, L",,,,"Braida, Lodovica",,,Novels to read and forget: an Italian anomaly of the Eighteenth Century,BIBLIOFILIA,,,Italian,Article,,,,,,,,"This essay brings together recent literary critical studies on the eighteenth-century Italian novel with those on book history and on reading. What lay behind the distrust of the novel as a genre, impeding its development and its diffusion in Italy? Church censorship was not the sole reason for the difficulties the Italian novel faced in its emegence as a genre. The problems are a good deal more complex. It was not only the censors and the clergy who took a negative view of novels; writers themselves who had developed within the parameters of official culture failed to identify with the new form, one, moreover, which was intended to entertain. Literary historical studies in the last two decades enable book historians to connect this work on the texts of the novels with the cultural context in which certain printers and booksellers invested in a publishing genre which, despite the difficulties it faced, managed to create a significant market over the course of the eighteenth century, with numerous editions and counterfeit editions, above all of works by the two most celebrated authors of the time, Pietro Chiari and Antonio Piazza. Yet in order to create this market for the novel, publisher-booksellers in Italy were obliged to adopt complex promotional strategies, from pretending that these works were translations of successful French or English novels to penning elaborate introductions for readers in which they tried to reassure the detractors of the genre (conservative men of letters and ecclesiastical censors). An example is the Venetian printer Angelo Pasinelli, who in an Avviso al lettore prefixed to the edition of L'uomo o sia memorie, ed avventure del co. di Senneval asserts that novels are merely a pleasurable pastime and are soon forgotten, leaving the mind free for more serious reading. They therefore present no danger to readers.",,,Lodovica.Braida@unimi.it,,,,,,27,0,0,0,0,CASA EDITRICE LEO S OLSCHKI,FLORENCE,"VIUZZO DEL POZZETTO, 8, I-50126 FLORENCE, ITALY",0006-0941,2035-6110,,BIBLIOFILIA,Bibliofilia,,2017,119,3,,,,,431,451,,,,,21,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,GG9EU,WOS:000433004500006,,,,,2020-08-21,

The new information retrieval system applies innovative methodology of the geographic information systems which visualizes bibliographic information and allows its utilization by means of topographic indexes. The elaboration of bibliographic database based on the principles of information retrieval systems and geographic information systems has a fundamental character for the development of the Bulgarian science and at the same time uses innovative methods, leading to sustained development of the scientific activities in the field of humanities and social sciences.

However, so far most corpus-based research in this field has been hampered by the manual nature of the visual analyses (see, e.g., Tyrkko, Marttila & Suhr 2013 and Tyrkko 2013). The manual measuring and evaluation of visual features in a consistent manner is both slow and prone to human error, particularly with volumes of texts sufficient for statistical interrogation. As a result, while the linguistic analysis of historical texts can be rigorously systematic and corpus-based, the visual data, when taken into account at all, have typically been rather scarce and anecdotal in nature. In this paper, I will discuss new computational methods of analysing diachronic changes in visual features of title-pages and body text, and of combining that information with linguistic data. Using two linguistic corpora, Early Modern English Medical Texts and Late Modern English Medical Texts, and ImagePlot 1.1, a tool designed for the analysis of visual data, I will first map the paratextual features of the medical books and turn them into a matrix of statistically usable data points (Manovich 2012, 2013) for further processing.","[Tyrkko, Jukka] Linnaeus Univ, Vaxjo, Sweden","Tyrkko, J (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Vaxjo, Sweden.",jukka.tyrkko@lnu.se,,,,,,47,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-3274,1651-2308,,STUD NEOPHILOL,Studia Neophilologica,,2017,89,,,1,SI,,90,108,,10.1080/00393274.2017.1376595,,,19,Language & Linguistics; Literature,Linguistics; Literature,FS7YI,WOS:000422625300007,,,,,2020-08-21,

This essay discusses the key concepts for his understanding of auctor and auctoritas in the field of jurisprudence, as well as the motivations for this uncommon inquiry into the notion of authorship. Besides his personal reasons (the rumors about the illegitimate authorship of some of his works), the detailed taxonomy of legal auctores also helped him to build a cogent argument against the validity of canon law in the United Provinces. His aim was to redesign the history of legal tradition and to dispute the authority of certain canon law sources, such as Gratian's Decretum.","[Beck Varela, Laura] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Legal Hist, Madrid, Spain","Varela, LB (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Legal Hist, Madrid, Spain.",laura.beck@uam.es,,,"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain [DER2014-56291-C3-1-P]; Max-Planck-Institut fur europaische Rechtsgeschichte (Frankfurt am Main)","This study was developed in the frame of the research project Tradicion y Constitucion (DER2014-56291-C3-1-P, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain, directed by Marta Lorente), and thanks to a fellowship grant of the Max-Planck-Institut fur europaische Rechtsgeschichte (Frankfurt am Main) during the spring of 2015.

Its case study is the Oxford Library of African Literature, edited in the mid-20th century by anthropologists E.E. Evans-Pritchard, Godfrey Lienhardt and W.H. Whiteley, who organized the transcription, translation, and publication of oral narratives from across Africa as hardback books. The first two volumes were commissioned with sponsorship from UNESCO, but few volumes included contributions from academics from Africa - notwithstanding Chinua Achebe's foreword for the first. By engaging with a rarely scrutinized literary collection, this article suggests that literarity is ultimately a colonialist construct and that orature, within this period, is only valued as gaining cultural capital as literature following its transcription and translation into English by British agents consecrating it into the model of the English book.","[Nunziata, Daniele] Univ Oxford, St Hughs Coll, Oxford, England","Nunziata, D (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, St Hughs Coll, Oxford, England.",daniele.nunziata@st-hughs.ox.ac.uk,,"Nunziata, Daniele/0000-0003-0448-5757",,,,53,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1744-9855,1744-9863,,J POSTCOLONIAL WRIT,J.

B. Wenzell's illustrations for The House of Mirth has long been recognized, and the images themselves have received critical attention. Virtually unknown, however, are the negotiations regarding illustration and presentation that took place among Wharton and her editors and publishers at Scribner's during this novel's preparation for serial and hardcover publication. Drawing on the Scribner's archives, I uncover the process via which Wharton, Edward L. Burlingame, William Crary Brownell, and Charles Scribner II determined the look of this novel in all its published forms: the eleven installments in Scribner's Magazine, each accompanied by an illustration; the 1905 hardcover, which included only eight illustrations; and the twelve pictureless copies of the latter that were custom-bound for Wharton. The files of the Scribner's art department contribute further hitherto-unknown information about the media of Wenzell's artworks and the fees he earned. Wharton's views on illustration and promotion, I argue, were closely tied to her sense of herself as a literary author, and were treated respectfully by her publishers even as they sought to balance her preferences with commercial imperatives.","[Wells, Juliette] Goucher Coll, Ctr Humanities, English, Baltimore, MD 21204 USA","Wells, J (corresponding author), Goucher Coll, Ctr Humanities, English, Baltimore, MD 21204 USA.",,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",2330-3964,2330-3980,,EDITH WHARTON REV,Edith Wharton Rev.,,2017,33,2,,,,,326,350,,10.5325/editwharrevi.33.2.0326,,,25,"Literature, American",Literature,FO2AB,WOS:000416571100004,,,,,2020-08-21,

In his writings on the liberal arts, he promoted a new order of learning to supplant scholastic traditions in grammar, logic, and rhetoric. Partly in response to social upheavals during the Reformation, he changed his view of the order of learning, as illustrated by comparison of his three principal writings on rhetoric, first published in 1519, 1521, and 1531. This essay examines the binding of these rhetorics into miscellanies (Sammelbande) by compiling lists of titles included in these miscellanies and suggests that such records reveal a shift in the reading of Melanchthon's work from an approach to rhetoric focused primarily upon eloquence to one focused more exclusively upon judgement.","[Weaver, William P.] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA","Weaver, WP (corresponding author), Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",,,,Alexander von Humboldt FellowshipAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,"Research for this essay was supported by an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship.

Lawrence; critical archive; edition; versioning; book history,,"The essay gives an account of the dealings of the editors of the Cambridge University Press Works of D. H. Lawrence series with the archive of Lawrence manuscript and other materials distributed in special collections of libraries around the world, collected mainly from the 1950s as his star began to rise. The essay considers the recent arguments of Suzanne Bost, making use of Jacques Derrida's argument in his essay Archive Fever, about the inevitably preconditioned interpretation of archival materials (Derrida) and the need to give them air before settling into a program of editorial or other analysis (Bost). The present essay grants Derrida his case in theory but argues for a more pragmatic approach based on the fruitfulness of the archival enquiry and citing as evidence the lessons learnt over the four decades of the Lawrence Works series. The first lesson is the essential versionality of Lawrence's writings, which is only partially captured in the scholarly editions. The second is the deep relevance of book history to scholarly editing, which is yet to make its presence felt in the literary critical domain of Lawrence studies. Finally, in a coda, the essay envisions a future vehicle for the presentation of a versional Lawrence: a critical archive in digital form. Its technical features are described partly via a critique of the recent Oxford Scholarly Editions Online. Giving the reader easy access to versions of works written around the same time, both in facsimile and transcription, is one requirement. Collaborative commentary is envisaged. Nevertheless, the traditional need to distinguish clearly between the archive and the edition the need to understand the latter as an argument about the former will remain in the digital environment.","[Eggert, Paul] Layola Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60660 USA","Eggert, P (corresponding author), Layola Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60660 USA.",peggert@luc.edu,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,ERICH SCHMIDT VERLAG,BERLIN-TIERGARTEN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 30G, D-10785 BERLIN-TIERGARTEN, GERMANY",0003-8970,,,ARCH STUD NEUE SPR,Arch.

Efforts to manage these precedents visually, in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, display a variety of solutions to the question of where precedents belong and how to represent them.

The reason lays in how well the genre served a variety of purposes; their language, for example, couched as they were in the idiom of high officialdom but still setting examples of the correct usage of the Italian vernacular. Not least, was their function as bearer of chronicles of contemporary events and famous personalities. The publication in 1564 of Sansovino's Del secretario launched a new genre of epistolary: the book was not only a collection of letters, but also a treatise on the role and function of the court secretary. Subsequently, texts and indexes took to being organized by rhetorical typology which enhanced their relevance.

The article examines a set of novels written by Pietro Chiari (1712-1785) that makes use of such title references. In the early stages of his novel production, Chiari mobilised French and British novel titles in an appropriation of these novelistic traditions. The Brescian writer then gradually abandoned the project of appropriation and began to reference only his own titles. Thus, the use of paratextual and in-text titles primarily took on an advertisement function. The article argues that these title references are embedded into a marketing strategy based on establishing a serial aspect to Chiari's novels.","[Haugen, Marius Warholm] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway","Haugen, MW (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway.",marius.haugen@ntnu.no,,,Norges Forskningsrad [240086],This work was supported by Norges Forskningsrad [grant number 240086].,,38,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0075-1634,1748-6181,,ITAL STUD,Ital.

The traumatic origin is a common trope in superhero comics, but the case of Magneto is significant for several reasons. The X-Men comics in the late 1970s and 1980s used the legacy of the Holocaust as a means to transform the Magneto character from villain to hero. This inclusion of the Holocaust was partly a response to contemporary developments in American observances of the Holocaust (creative and institutional). Even though this conflation of history and fiction was meant to facilitate a new identity, it yielded a vexed identity politics that endured in the comics for decades. Magneto had originally been a villain, defined by his notions of genetic supremacy and his willingness to employ mass violence against those he deemed genetically inferior. These early - associations remained in the character even as they were insistently overwritten by his (new) past as a Holocaust survivor. At the same time, the comics refrained from identifying Magneto as a Jew-that identity was suggested but never stated. The result was a controversial paradox, a character who was both Nazi and Jew.","[Smith, Scott Thompson] Penn State Univ, English & Comparat Literature, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Smith, ST (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, English & Comparat Literature, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,69,0,0,0,4,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",0271-9274,1948-5077,,STUD AM JEW LIT,Stud.

But how can its visual and material qualities be arranged so as to intentionally produce specific effects according to the author's or editor's persuasive purpose? In order to answer this question about the book's rhetoric of media, this paper adopts three approaches. First, a brief historical overview charts the functions and effectiveness of the book as a mass medium. Secondly, a comparison between Classical oratorical techniques and the book's visual and typographic practices proves they have extensive rhetorical principles and strategies in common. Finally, the works of two authors from different ages -Alexander von Humboldt and Jonathan Safran Foer serve as practical examples to illustrate how the book's typographic and design features can be understood as genuinely rhetorical.","[Nehrlich, Thomas] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland","Nehrlich, T (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland.",,,,,,,66,1,1,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-11-031825-8; 978-3-11-031812-8,HANDB RHETORIK,,,2017,6,,,,,,257,289,,,,,33,Communication,Communication,BN5JX,WOS:000483458800015,,,,,2020-08-21,

This historiographical gap can partly be explained by the lack of a theoretical framework for studying the market for translations in the period. Drawing on Robert Darnton's communication circuit and its adaptations by various book and translation historians, we have created a model for studying printed translations in early modern England (1473-1660). Centred on translators as key historical and cultural agents, it will facilitate a critically and historically accurate investigation of translations as material and cultural objects, while highlighting the specific contribution of translators to the social, political and cultural networks that shaped the early modern English culture of print.","[Belle, Marie-Alice; Hosington, Brenda M.] Univ Montreal, Dept Linguist & Traduct, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hosington, Brenda M.] Univ Warwick, Ctr Study Renaissance, Coventry, W Midlands, England","Belle, MA (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Linguist & Traduct, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Hosington, BM (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Ctr Study Renaissance, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",marie-alice.belle@umontreal.ca,"ZHAO, Gary/E-7678-2017",,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada/Conseil de Recherches en Sciences humainesSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [435-2013-1603, 1473-1660]",We should like to thank the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada/Conseil de Recherches en Sciences humaines for a three-year Insight Grant (grant number 435-2013-1603) for our project entitled 'Translation and the Making of Early Modern Print Culture (1473-1660)'.

The manuscript contains a partial translation into French of Annius of Viterbo's Antiquities, first published in Rome in 1498 and purporting to be ancient texts relating the history of the world around the time of the Flood. Although previous scholars have noted the close reliance on the Antiquities by Jean Lemaire des Belges in his Illustrations de Gaule et singularites de Troyes (1511-13), the translation offered to Anne is unknown. Here I argue that Anne's personalized manuscript and translation predates Lemaire des Belges' work, indicating that she and Pierre were early players in an emerging courtly interest in translated works relating to antiquity. In addition, I suggest that the choice of text and the manuscript's frontispiece by a leading court artist showing Anne receiving the book meant that it was designed to appeal to, and likely shaped, Anne's interests in literature and translation which are later evident in her own library and writings for the French queen, Claude.","[L'Estrange, Elizabeth] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","L'Estrange, E (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-1213,1477-4658,,RENAISS STUD,Renaiss.

Probably first published in 1634, The Wandering Jew's Chronicle most commonly survives as a 'broadside ballad'-a cheaply-printed song-sheet-illustrated with woodcut portraits of kings and queens of England. It remained in print until ca. 1830, its text and illustrations updated to the present. Although in partial synchrony with English history, much of its publishing history and textual descent is uncertain. This article demonstrates how historical evidence, taken in particular from book trade history, may be usefully combined with textual and bibliographical evidence, and that it is at times essential for understanding the descent of the text.

It addresses the impact of the military on the marketplace of print and examines the cultural importance of commercial printmaking to the visualization of colonial motifs during the 1684-99 war with the Ottoman Empire. Through a broad array of single-sheet engravings and illustrated books encompassing different visual typologies (e.g. maps, siege views, battle scenes, portraits of Venetian patricians, and representations of the Ottomans), the article re-examines key questions about the imperial dimensions of Venetian print culture and book history. In particular, it shows how warfare and colonial politics militarized the communication media, and highlights the manner in which prints engaged metropolitan viewers in the Republic's expansionist ventures. In so doing, the analysis demonstrates how the printing industry brought the visual spectacle of empire onto the centre stage of Venetian cultural life.","[Stouraiti, Anastasia] Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Hist, London SE14 6NW, England","Stouraiti, A (corresponding author), Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Hist, London SE14 6NW, England.",a.stouraiti@gold.ac.uk,,,Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust,"The research for this article has been generously funded by the Leverhulme Trust, support which I gratefully acknowledge.

This article claims that Riegl's argument was originally made in images as well as in text, but that his visual rhetoric was lost when Otto Pacht edited Late Roman Art Industry for republication in 1927 and changed its illustrations. The article demonstrates that Pacht's pictorial amendments manifest the concerns of a new generation of formalist art historians, raising broader questions regarding the role of photography in art history's disciplinary codification.

The basic legal and administrative documents governing the establishment of free public libraries, library supervision and library funds are given. The system of reading regulation began to take shape in 1890 when The Rules on Free Public Libraries and Order of Supervising Them were put into effect. The Rules allowed to simplify the procedure of opening of the libraries and made it dependent of the governor. The selection of books was limited by the recommendations of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Orthodox Confession. Archive documents that were not previously introduced into scientific circulation were used in the article. The documents show how government regulation was implemented in Tomsk Province; in particular, materials of the library of the Society to Promote Public Education were under study. A. Misyurev was responsible for the library of the Society; quotations from his report of 1905, where all his duties were described in details, catalogue with the lists of books prohibited in public libraries, on verification of texts intended for public readings, as well as on lists of lecturers. Examples are also given that show that local officials could not cope with the control of library funds; in particular, there is an example of the Tomsk Public Assembly library, which was, in fact, the town's elite club. A number of prohibited books of V. Korolenko, D. Pisarev and others were found in the library, but the case was hushed up. There were other cases, too: the head of the book storehouse for schools in Barnaul, M. Kuklin, was fired in 1906 because he had a large number of anti-government editions. Characteristically, the case was initiated by the police, not the local officials of the Ministry of Education. The article also describes the audit of printing houses, public libraries and bookstores conducted by S. Lavrent'ev in Novonikolaevsk, Biysk and Barnaul in 1916. The audit showed that some libraries were not checked at all, and library staff did not have an access to the lists of prohibited books. Methods used to circumvent government's prohibitions are revealed. They included withdrawing of the prohibited books from the libraries and putting them in personal collections of librarians, or opening of a library intended for the members of a society only, later such a library became public. In general the article demonstrates that the reading regulation system failed at the level of local officials in the first place. Dramatic increase of the number of public libraries was an important factor as well; as a result, regulatory authorities did not cope with the increased workload.","[Esipova, Valeriya A.] Tomsk State Univ, Res Lib, Tomsk, Russia; [Kartashova, Tatiana P.] Tomsk Museum Local Hist, Tomsk, Russia","Esipova, VA (corresponding author), Tomsk State Univ, Res Lib, Tomsk, Russia.",esipova_val@mail.ru; kartashova67@yandex.ru,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2306-2061,2311-3774,,TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZD,Tekst Kniga Knigoizd.,AUG,2016,11,2,,,,,96,109,,10.17223/23062061/11/6,,,14,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VH4LO,WOS:000453174000006,,Bronze,,,2020-08-21,

This continuity in turn suggests that recent research on lost books and missing editions, which points towards a much higher number of lost fifteenth-century editions than previously believed, is also relevant for the study of late medieval manuscripts, especially for smaller vernacular works. Shifting the perspective from the books and manuscripts that survive today to those that likely once existed compels a reconsideration of late medieval literacy and the literary context for smaller works, such as the Stricker's Pfaffe Amis, that were printed in the fifteenth century.","[Green, Jonathan] Univ N Dakota, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA","Green, J (corresponding author), Univ N Dakota, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA.",,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0037-1939,1911-026X,,SEMINAR-J GER STUD,Semin.-J.

When it was published, for the first time the testimony of an Holocaust survivor was genuinely narrated through a comic book. Nonetheless, questions were raised regarding the nature of Maus and whether it was a biography or a fiction. A comic book, even more a comic book depicting the Holocaust with animals representing humans, couldn't be a representation of reality, while a text, or a movie, cause no such question regarding the transposition of reality through a way or another. Such questions surrounding Maus shed light on a broader topic, the common perception of drawing. It can be summarized by a simple statement: drawing is art. While tens of thousands drawings were drawn by Holocaust (or Third Reich) victims, they are usually seen has illustrations, pieces of art, while they should be seen for what they are really: first and foremost draw testimonies, i.e. sources, which should be analyzed and used as such. Maus is also milestone in comic book history. Then the comic industry, both in Europe and the US, was perceived essentially as a children media. Maus is one of the comic books published in the 1980's which changed the perception of the genre and gave to it credibility. If Maus had a major impact on the public opinion regarding comic books, it had also a major impact on the genre itself and is by many aspects a turning point. It innovates on various aspects: one of the first autobiographical comic books, the project was conducted during almost two decades, from the beginning of the 1970's until 1991 and the publication of the second, and final, volume, with a format previously unseen. And while before its publication only a handful of comic books dared to address the Holocaust, since dozens comics books did so.",,,tal.bruttmann@free.fr,,,,,,5,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1740-9292,1740-9306,,CONTEMP FR FRANCOPH,Contemp.

Hachette's cheap and luridly coloured cardboard-covered books for children that flooded the French market in the long sixties formed an important and yet overlooked component of what Sirinelli calls the `rejuvenation' of French mass culture, when the young became an important new market. Using the extensive archives of Hachette's children's department, this essay analyses how the editors responded to the unprecedented growth and important structural changes that historians concur were taking place in the children's publishing industry across the West in the post-war period. This novel approach, which draws upon the methodologies of the sociology of publishing and book history, asks what can the editors' perspective teach us about this key period in children's publishing history?

G.",,,TO THE QUESTION OF THE USE OF THE ETHNIC TERM TATARS IN ARAB HISTORICAL LITERATURE,ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Golden Horde; term; Tatars; Mongols; Mamluks; Arab historiography,,"Reconstruction of the ethnogenesis of the peoples inhabited the Golden Horde is one of the issues being studied intensively in modern historical scholarship. Medieval Arab sources play an important role in studying the history of the peoples of the Golden Horde. Study of contemporary Arab authors' historical researches where medieval Arab chronicles are analyzed in greater detail, is necessary to understand their importance. Objective: study of the Arab historical literature regarding the issue of the use of the ethnic term Tatars. Some contemporary Arab historical researches are used as materials for this research. For example, Muhammad Sahil Takkush calls the Golden Horde - Magul-Kypchak, and Iran - Magul-Faris in his book History of the Mamluks in Egypt and Syria. Qasim Abdel Qasim, the author of the book Era of the Mamluk Sultans, calls the Golden Horde bilad al-kypchak. In his work The Mamluks, Shaydiyaz al-Garini calls Berke the khan of the Golden Horde tribe and the Golden Horde inhabitants - at-tatar al-kypchak, i.e. the Kypchak Tatars. Of particular interest is the book of Egyptian historian Muhammad Abdelgani al-Ashqar Salar - the Tatar Muslim Emir (Naib of the Mamluk Sultan in Egypt, 1260-1310). It describes the reign of Sultan al-Malik an-Nasir Muhammad who was in close friendly relations with the Golden Horde khan Uzbek. It is known that the Golden Horde Muslims prayed for Sultan al-Malik al-Nasir mentioning his name after khan Uzbek. Long-term friendship between the Golden Horde and Egypt eventually led to the conclusion of a dynastic marriage between Egyptian Sultan an-Nasir and the Golden Horde princess Tulunbay. As a result, the study of the use of the ethnic term Tatars in Arab historical literature remains relevant and requires a review of some of the preconceived ideas about the ethnic history of the Tatar people in the Arab world in favor of the in-depth study of this problem.","[Sayfetdinova, E.

Vol. I. The Nomads of the Great Steppe in the Cisuralic Region. Medieval Tatar States [1] has been published by Sh. Marjani Institute of History (Kazan, 2016). The volume is dedicated to the medieval period and ends with the fall of the Kazan Khanate. The monograph has been prepared under the supervision of Doctor of Historical Studies, R.S. Khakimov. Editorial board of the monograph consists of leading scholars from academic centers in Russia and abroad. The book is divided into 4 chapters. The first chapter talks about the history of ancient nomads in the Cisuralic region. The second chapter examines the Volga-Kama Bulgaria and political unification of the Turkic nomads. The third chapter is dedicated to the formation of the Golden Horde state and the history of the formation of the Tatar people. The final fourth chapter discusses the Tatar khanates (Kazan and Siberian yurts, the Nogai Horde). An appendix including 55 narrative source is an important part of the collective monograph History of the Tatars of the Cisuralic Region. The authors of the first volume have not only succeeded to considerably fill the lacuna of historical knowledge about the Cisuralic Tatars, but also largely revise existing ideas about ethnogenesis of other Turko-Tatar and Finno-Ugric peoples in the region. This work does not provide all the answers. However, the important thing is that the authors of the monograph have succeeded to present new problems and outline prospects for further research. In the future, it is necessary to continue to study the process of ethnic migrations, which began in the Cisuralic region in the middle of the 16th century as well as the problems linked to the inclusion of these communities into the Russian state and other issues related to the history of the Cisuralic Tatars.","[Sayfetdinova, E.

But it was in the publishing house Moraes, with its innovative editorial policy, that this group of progressive Catholics created a new form of political and artistic action with their interventionist humanism. If the publisher's identity was revealed in its catalog, its cultural revolutionary and socially subversive impact can be measured by the weight of the censorial persecution to which its publications were subject.

The comparative approach will allow to realize to what extent the possible similarities and differences in institutional structures created by similar authoritarian regimes had relations with genealogy, the ideological profile and the type of impact created.","[Melo, Daniel] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCSH, CHAM, Lisbon, Portugal; [Melo, Daniel] Univ Acores, Ponta Delgada, Portugal","Melo, D (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, FCSH, CHAM, Lisbon, Portugal.; Melo, D (corresponding author), Univ Acores, Ponta Delgada, Portugal.",daniel.melo@fcsh.unl.pt,"Melo, Daniel J S/H-2176-2011","Melo, Daniel J S/0000-0003-4573-3497",,,,34,2,3,0,1,"UNIV COIMBRA, FAC LETRAS",COIMBRA,"CENTRO HIST SOCIEDADE, LARGO PORTA FERREA, COIMBRA, 3004-530, PORTUGAL",1645-2259,,,REV HIST SOC CULT,Rev.

By radically abridging the collected writings of Johnson and distilling them into a marketable form, Mathews constructs particular ways of reading the poetry book of the fin de siecle and of creating a poetry book that could function as a seductive short encounter for the reader. This essay explores the critical spirit informing the posthumous editions of Johnson's poetic works and how such key figures of the period as Mathews, Yeats, and Pound articulated their critical revisions of fin de siecle poetic practices through the selective editing of Johnson's complex poetic style. This essay argues that this kind of strategic revision of late-Victorian lyricism, decoration, and ritualized poetics does not merely function in relation to decorative publishing practices of the fin de siecle or as a denial of Johnson's aesthetic sensibilities but that it points to a broader cultural criticism of Victorian aesthetic excess and of mid-to late-Victorian aesthetic ideology.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,"UNIV P MONTPELLIERI III-PAUL VALERY, SERVICES PUBLICATIONS",MONTPELLIER-CEDEX 1,"ROUTE MENDE, BP 5043, 34032 MONTPELLIER-CEDEX 1, FRANCE",0220-5610,,,CAH VICTOR EDOUARD,Cah.

As a republishing of essays and short fiction in volume form, Sketches provides a locus classicus for book-history studies. Critics have shown little interest, however, in the originary volume of Sketches's debut as a 'whole book', the two-volume edition of 1836, otherwise known as the First Series: most scholarly treatments take for their copy-text the 1839 edition. This essay reads the First Series in dialectic with the 1839 edition to discuss Dickens's ambivalence toward ideas of authorship embodied in the material book. Where the 1839 Sketches uses death as an emblem of aesthetic fixity, the First Series celebrates inexhaustibility. Rather than suggesting a return to some pure, unmediated encounter with Dickens's work, I emphasize textual materiality as a variable that has shaped receptions of both editions of Sketches and read the First Series to show how it, paradoxically, relies on the technology of the book to resist a sense of bookish closure.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,"UNIV P MONTPELLIERI III-PAUL VALERY, SERVICES PUBLICATIONS",MONTPELLIER-CEDEX 1,"ROUTE MENDE, BP 5043, 34032 MONTPELLIER-CEDEX 1, FRANCE",0220-5610,,,CAH VICTOR EDOUARD,Cah.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors review historical features of books and practices of reading that have been implemented, weakened, or lost over time, referring to historical texts and resources, and relate them to ebook viewers (software) and readers (hardware) that are currently on the market. In particular, the review focuses on the physical form of the book and the practices of reading, annotation, and bookshelving. Findings - While some older forms and reading practices have been implemented in ebook devices, others have been forgotten over time, due in part to physical constraints that are no longer relevant. The authors suggest that features that constrained print books and print reading in the past might actually improve the design of ebooks and e-reading in the present. Research limitations/implications - This review is necessarily based on a limited set of existing historical sources. Practical implications - Translating insights into novel tangible designs is always a challenging task. Ebook designers can gain insights from this paper that can be applied in a variety of design contexts. Originality/value - No previous work on ebook design has foregrounded historical aspects of books and reading as viable sources of ideas to implement in ebooks.","[Koh, HyunSeung; Herring, Susan C.] Indiana Univ, Dept Informat & Lib Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Koh, H (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Informat & Lib Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",hskoh@umail.iu.edu,,,,,,63,0,0,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0737-8831,,,LIBR HI TECH,Libr.

However, the impact that these instruments had on the reading public has yet to be determined. This paper argues that the inclusion of paper instruments in Peter Apian's Cosmographia transforms the text into a book-instrument hybrid. The instruments and accompanying text in Cosmographia enabled readers to make their own measurements and calculations of both the heavens and the earth. Through the experience of manipulating the instruments, the readers became participants in sixteenth century mathematical culture, and thus mathematical amateurs. I conclude that the presence of these mathematical amateurs contributed to a much broader social base for the cultural shift towards an empirical understanding of nature from 1500 to 1700.","[Gaida, Margaret] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Hist Sci, 601 Elm,Ph Sc 625, Norman, OK 73071 USA","Gaida, M (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Hist Sci, 601 Elm,Ph Sc 625, Norman, OK 73071 USA.",margaret.gaida@ou.edu,,,,,,85,1,1,0,1,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1383-7427,,,EARLY SCI MED,Early Sci.

Drawing on conceptual work being undertaken at the Western Sydney University in order to further develop and extend the widely respected French Book Trade in Enlightenment Europe' (FBTEE) database project, it explores how historians might proceed to correlate, map, and analyse multiple spatially referenced data sets pertaining to the creation, publication, dissemination, ownership, consumption, reception, policing, and geographic setting of texts. While the authors recognise the many dangers and limitations inherent in reducing the cultural history of text to a set of statistical data, they observe that historians frequently use the production and circulation of texts as a useful proxy for understanding the circulation of ideas. Hence historical bibliometrics can provide measurable indicators of cultural resonance. The challenge, then, is to meaningfully integrate algorithmic abstractions with qualitative-based humanities research. This paper and the suite of projects it discusses seek to provide a way forward.","[Burrows, Simon] Univ Western Sydney, Hist, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; [Burrows, Simon; Ensor, Jason] Univ Western Sydney, Digital Humanitics Res Grp, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; [Henningsgaard, Per] Portland State Univ, English Fac, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Hiribarren, Vincent] Kings Coll London, Modern African Hist, London WC2R 2LS, England","Burrows, S (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Hist, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.; Burrows, S (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Digital Humanitics Res Grp, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.",s.burrows@westernsydney.edu.au,,"Ensor, Jason/0000-0002-3066-927X; Burrows, Simon/0000-0002-6897-8801; Henningsgaard, Per/0000-0001-8118-9260",,,,27,2,2,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1758-3489,1758-3497,,LIBR INF HIST,Libr.

Through title-page advertisements, prefaces and indexes, these 'print agents' forged unique relationships with new and returning readers. Paying attention to paratextual structures can uncover strategies for marketing new books, corralling readers and outlining new genres. A consideration of framing devices can also further our understanding of digital resources: much as print agents mediated printed books, digital humanists help reinforce the value of new technologies for the study of early modern texts, guiding users to apply new methods of research, and helping establish new areas of scholarship. As a new kind of print agent, digital humanists must be more aware of their choices in curating, organising and labeling metadata. As we rethink what it means to read, edit and disseminate texts through the digital medium, we must also understand the degree to which modern and early modern editorial practices challenge and influence our scholarship and criticism.","[Silva, Andie] CUNY, York Coll, Dept English, Jamaica, NY 11451 USA","Silva, A (corresponding author), CUNY, York Coll, Dept English, Jamaica, NY 11451 USA.",asilva@york.cuny.edu,,,,,,38,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0191-6599,1873-541X,,HIST EUR IDEA,Hist.

Above all, the publication of the five-volume, illustrated Goethe edition by Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt (1882-85) initiated a vibrant debate about the appropriateness of literary illustration. By invoking the tropes of lazy reader, interloping illustrator, and illustrated book as national treasure, critics adapted the rhetoric of the luxury and reading debates of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As a counterreaction to the democratizing impact of the German Klassikerjahr, commentators framed illustrated book editions as suitable for the intellectual and economic elite, rejecting the common argument for illustration as a means of broadening readership.","[Peterson, Shane D.] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Foreign Languages, German, 1000 Chastain Rd NW,MD 1804, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA","Peterson, SD (corresponding author), Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Foreign Languages, German, 1000 Chastain Rd NW,MD 1804, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",speter71@kennesaw.edu,,,,,,37,0,0,0,0,FRANCKE VERLAG,TUBINGEN,"DISCHINGERWEG 5, D-72070 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0010-1338,,,COLLOQ GERMANICA,Colloq.

Far from being a collection of names, a record of last resort for historians seeking a substitute for more systematic sources, or a form of ephemera, the visitors' books are tools to reconstruct tourist markets, and also records of commercial evolution, intercultural encounter, discursive practice, cultural evaluation, literary cultures, and book history.","[James, Kevin J.] Univ Guelph, Dept Hist, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Vincent, Patrick] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Langue & Litterature Anglaises, Neuchatel, Switzerland","James, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Hist, Guelph, ON, Canada.",kjames@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,122,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-182X,1755-1838,,J TOUR HIST,J.

The essay has two primary goals. The first is to contextualize the Contact Poetry Reading Series as a fundamental component of Raymond Souster's editorial work in order to enrich dominant critical perspective of Souster's accomplishments as an editor and publisher. The Contact readings express the same drive on Souster's part to make contact (between generations, between international communities, between poet and reader) that is identifiable in his work with Contact and Contact Press, only in this case under material conditions unique to the public performance of poetry. The second goal is to situate the Contact Poetry Reading Series within current book history and performance studies scholarship. In doing so, this essay positions the literary reading as an essential but understudied component of processes of publication, distribution, and reception of poetry in Canada.","[Anstee, Cameron] Univ Toronto, Dept English, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada","Anstee, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept English, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,57,1,1,0,0,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0021-9495,1911-0251,,J CAN STUD,J.

Building upon a growing literature at the intersection of book history and the history of science, I argue that paleontologists developed plaster casts as a compromise medium that combined some features of print with others from original natural history specimens. For example, because plaster casts were mechanical reproductions, they could be fabricated in fairly large numbers at a relatively modest price. This allowed them to circulate more readily than original fossils. At the same time, however, paleontologists treated casts as a material trace of prehistory, much like an original fossil itself. As a result, they were seen as especially authoritative and trustworthy objects of knowledge. Insofar as they combined features of print and prehistory, I argue that casts functioned as a genuine mode of publication in late-nineteenth-century paleontology, but one that foregrounded its own materiality.","[Rieppel, Lukas] Brown Univ, Dept Hist, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Rieppel, L (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Box N,79 Brown St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Lukas_Rieppel@Brown.edu,,,Brown University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The production of this essay was supported by a Richard B.

This essay considers the flexible web of connections in poetic miscellanies as an imaginative response to that basic disorder. Reading the organization of two editions of George Gascoigne's work, it explores the dynamic exchanges between poems and commercial textual features and finds in those feedback loops an ambitious projection of the larger form of the book. Far from a simple or inherent unity, this paratactic structure uses poetry to span the physical juxtapositions of books made by diverse agents of the press. By forging an inferential engagement with the design of the volume, Gascoigne resisted a system of publication bent on dispersing his writing and folded nonauthorial devices into the most elemental workings of poetic form.","[Heffernan, Megan] Depaul Univ, English, Chicago, IL 60604 USA","Heffernan, M (corresponding author), Depaul Univ, English, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",,,,,,,44,0,0,0,0,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",0026-7929,,,MOD LANG QUART,Mod.

One of the major problems the history of reading is facing now is the problem of the relationship between these tree types of transformation. The problem of correlation between the repertoire of publications and the use of different replication techniques is considered in the article on the example of the collections of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Department of Tomsk State University Research Library. Collections of manuscripts (mainly dated by the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries) and collection Lithography and Typewritten Books were under study. There obviously was a redistribution of the repertoire between the various techniques of replication: thus, the relative number of manuscripts of scientific and educational character decreased with time, but the number of scientific papers written on a typewriter, and lecture notes reproduced by lithography and the hectograph increased. The redistribution between different techniques of replication grew in the 20th century due to the emergence of new techniques of replication, in particular, without typesetting (collotype, electrographic copy). They allowed increasing the speed of edition production and reducing its cost; all this affected the author's choice in favor of a certain reproducing technique. The new methods of replication did not follow each other sequentially, but coexisted; so, the author had a possibility to choose a method of replication depending on replication tasks, time and cost. For instance, the choice of the hectograph or lithography as a replication technique was due to a relatively low cost and a small size of readership. Using a typewriter is typical for manuscripts of scientists and writers, not intended directly for publication. Hectograph copies of business documentation ensured that a large range of people had identical copies of the text. It is proved that appearance of new methods of book replication leads to changes in the book repertoire, which reflects the behavior of the author and the reader in connection with new technical possibilities. The coexistence of different replication techniques and a choice between them are reflected in the editions repertoire. These processes occur simultaneously, but at different speeds and in different rhythm, which determines the concrete historical picture of regional book history.","[Esipova, Valeriya A.] Tomsk State Univ, Res Lib, Tomsk, Russia","Esipova, VA (corresponding author), Tomsk State Univ, Res Lib, Tomsk, Russia.",esipova_val@mail.ru,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2306-2061,2311-3774,,TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZD,Tekst Kniga Knigoizd.,DEC,2015,9,2,,,,,106,116,,10.17223/23062061/9/8,,,11,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VH4LH,WOS:000453173200009,,Bronze,,,2020-08-21,

However, the cornerstone of bureaucracy seems to rest on both unexpected and anticipated effects of creativity and imagination, whether related to the work of government officials and origins of sovereignty, force fields and contemporary science development, or superheroes and comic book history. Graeber not only illustrates why our life has been organized around filling out forms (p. 44), but gives it a wider scale through an anthropological understanding of bureaucratic practices and technologies. The interesting thing is that he never gives a precise definition of what bureaucracy really is and where we can find it, but in the disenchanted modernity and modern capitalist economy it seems to be omnipresent. The book is divided into four thematic parts: the first is the structural violence and deliberate stupidity of bureaucratic institutions; the second questions scientific development and claims that we have moved from poetic to bureaucratic technologies; the third one is rationality and playfulness and their relation to human nature; and the last one (in an Appendix) considers the link between creativity and violence and the role of bureaucracy in it.","[Gudova, Elena] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Gudova, Elena] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Sociol, Moscow 101000, Russia","Gudova, E (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia.",egudova@hse.ru,,,,,,23,0,0,0,3,NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS,MOSCOW,"SHABOLOVKA, 26, MOSCOW, 119049, RUSSIA",1726-3247,,,J ECON SOCIOL,J.

J,"Koziol, S",,,,"Koziol, Slavomir",,,Those Clunky Things You Have to Carry Around: Textual Materiality in Vernor Vinge's Rainbows End,SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article analyzes textual materiality in Vernor Vinge's Rainbows End, a 2006 sf novel set in the near future. The theoretical impetus for the analysis is provided by N. Katherine Hayles's investigation of the contemporary pressure toward dematerialization caused by the growing popularity of digital machines and the science of cybernetics, which, apart from influencing our understanding of the idea of the human, affects also our perception of textual embodiment. As a result, the materiality of books starts to be regarded as something expendable, an old-fashioned kind of interface with no meaning whatsoever. Disgreeing with this view of books, Hayles argues that textual materiality is one of their essential characteristics, as the physical form plays an important role in the cultural chain of these texts' production, assimilation, and influence. Taking into account works by Hayles and other writers dealing with book history, editing, archival science, and the digital revolution in general, the article proceeds to analyze, first, the conflict over digitization of an academic library as depicted in Vinge's novel, and second, the creative crisis that the main character a poet experiences as a result. Ultimately, it is argued, the relationship among author, text, and reader, as presented in the novel, illuminates debates about textual materiality taking place in contemporary digital-humanities scholarship.","[Koziol, Slavomir] Univ Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland; [Koziol, Slavomir] Univ Rzeszow, British Literature, Rzeszow, Poland","Koziol, S (corresponding author), Univ Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland.",,,,,,,31,1,1,0,5,SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES,GREENCASTLE,"DEPAUW UNIV, DEPT ROMANCE LANGUAGES, GREENCASTLE, IN 46135-0037 USA",0091-7729,,,SCI-FICTION STUD,Sci.-Fict.

A number of economic imperatives influenced the publishing process, including the perennial difficulty in finding psychiatrists willing and able to enter the popular book market; the economic pressures exerted on peer-review protocols; and the identification of a niche market in popular psychiatry, latterly of a politically radical flavour.

Using Montaigne's chapter De l'oisivet as a point of departure, this article assesses the convergence of literary and medical discourses, and the significance of book-historical research. Since the linguistic turn, historians increasingly examine how medical texts crossed generic boundaries, sharing many strategies of literary discourse. Equally, recent attention, within book history, to la politique editoriale, requires us to ask how early modern medical as well as literary books came into print and circulated. My comparison of Joubert's Erreurs populaires (1578) and Montaigne's Essais (1580), two surprising bestsellers, both published in Bordeaux by Simon Millanges, focuses specifically on the presentation of molar pregnancies by each author.

In this article, I challenge such a reading by demonstrating how transatlantic connections shaped both the publication and the reception of Morton's atlas. In this lavish folio volume, complete with over seventy lithographic plates, Morton divides mankind into five races on the basis of skull configuration. However, to date, there have been no histories which consider the relevance of Morton's extensive correspondence with physicians, naturalists, and phrenologists in Europe. Furthermore, there have been no studies which consider how Morton managed the reception of Crania Americana across the Atlantic Ocean. This article resituates American ethnology within this transatlantic world, drawing on archival collections in both Britain and the United States. More broadly, it demonstrates how the history of the book can be developed as we move beyond national contexts.","[Poskett, James] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 2RH, England","Poskett, J (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB3 2RH, England.",jdgp2@cam.ac.uk,,,"Trinity College, University of CambridgeUniversity of Cambridge; British Society for the History of Science; Philadelphia Area Center for the History of Science","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this research was kindly provided by Trinity College, University of Cambridge, the British Society for the History of Science and the Philadelphia Area Center for the History of Science.",,108,5,5,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0073-2753,1753-8564,,HIST SCI,Hist.

J,"Roy, M",,,,"Roy, Michael",,,"Cheap Editions, Little Books, and Handsome Duodecimos: A Book History Approach to Antebellum Slave Narratives",MELUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this essay I look at three canonical antebellum slave narratives from a book-historical perspective-the narratives of James Williams (1838), Frederick Douglass (1845), and Solomon Northup (1853)-to show that, despite similarities in terms of content, these works differed greatly in both formal and cultural terms. While Narrative of James Williams was published as a piece of anti-slavery propaganda and wholly embedded in abolitionist discourse, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave was a much more personal literary endeavor, which involved Douglass himself as well as informal abolitionist networks. Released a year after Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, in the context of the Uncle Tom mania of the early 1850s, Northup's Twelve Years a Slave was, to a large extent, a commercial venture that capitalized on the latest literary trend. Each of these three narratives, therefore, occupied a different space in antebellum print culture. By examining how these texts were published and circulated, I show that generalizations about antebellum slave narratives-slave narratives as bestsellers, as directed toward a Northern white audience, as a distinct genre recognizable by all-distort the complex history of this literary tradition. I argue that acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of what we usually perceive as a homogeneous whole gives us a better sense of how these texts might have been variously received and consumed in the decades preceding the Civil War.","Univ Paris 13, English, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France","Roy, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris 13, English, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",michael.roy@univ-paris13.fr,,,,,,84,2,2,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0163-755X,1946-3170,,MELUS,MELUS,FAL,2015,40,3,,,,,69,93,,10.1093/melus/mlv032,,,25,"Literature, American",Literature,CR4JN,WOS:000361298200007,,,,,2020-08-21,

This is well known to scholars and students alike. But the question now arises, with the rise over the last 20 to 30 years of 'Radical Enlightenment' as a fundamental new category in the humanities, how much has this category applicability in the Central European context? Studying book history and print culture, I shall argue, helps us to determine that in fact it does.","Inst Adv Study, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Israel, J (corresponding author), Inst Adv Study, Einstein Dr, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",jisrael@ias.edu,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1062-7987,1474-0575,,EUR REV,Eur.

First, how did George Lippard's The Quaker City develop from a multimedia story told through newspaper conventions, illustration, and two plays into the novel that appeared in May 1845? And second, how did Lippard's white-seduction narrative come to pivot around the nightmare of an ambiguously raced Devil-Bug? Joining these questions of form and content, I argue that the media history of The Quaker City is inextricable from its history of race. In the wake of the almost riot around the mid-serialization of his Philadelphia play, Lippard moved away from fictionalizing current events toward the grotesque-sublime through a broader critique of Philadelphia less open to charges of libel. This shift took place through the transformation of Devil-Bug, a character Lippard rapidly developed in the middle installments until he was complex enough to carry the new story. Turning the once-black Devil-Bug into his protagonist, however, required character developments that necessarily complicated the story's representation of race, a process that occurred concurrently with events related to the work that highlighted the systemic oppression of African Americans. In winter 1844, troubles with two stage productions and his illustrator highlighted the problems of representing race. After a several-month hiatus, Lippard published new installments vituperously condemning the representational limits of these nonprose forms and turned to prose to develop his antislavery position through Devil-Bug. As a result of these confluent developments, The Quaker City became an antislavery text through the process of opening Devil-Bug's character up to its own hybridity and interiority.","Emory Univ, English, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Altschuler, S (corresponding author), Emory Univ, English, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,,,,41,3,3,0,1,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",0891-9356,,,NINETEEN CENT LIT,Ninet.-Century Lit.,JUN,2015,70,1,,,SI,,65,101,,10.1525/ncl.2015.70.1.65,,,37,Literature,Literature,CL4FX,WOS:000356909100003,,,,,2020-08-21,

Histories of plastic surgery currently state that after Tagliacozzi's death in 1599, his procedure disappeared from medical knowledge. I demonstrate that this was not the case through a thorough book history of an English translation of De curtorum chirurgia published in London in 1687 and 1696 that was attached to the collected works of the Scottish surgeon Alexander Read. In the seventeenth century, the disfigured nose became associated with the effects of syphilis and its mercury treatment, and I examine this relationship in order to account for rhinoplasty's stigmatization, and medical resistance to using the procedure that led to its alleged disappearance in the period.","Univ Adelaide, Barr Smith Lib, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Cock, E (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Barr Smith Lib, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",emily.cock@adelaide.edu.au,,"Cock, Emily/0000-0001-5690-8198","Bill Cowan Fellowship in the Barr Smith Library, the University of Adelaide","Research for this paper was completed within the Bill Cowan Fellowship in the Barr Smith Library, the University of Adelaide.

J,"Weber, M",,,,"Weber, Millicent",,,Conceptualizing audience experience at the literary festival,CONTINUUM-JOURNAL OF MEDIA & CULTURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The literary festival has been variously claimed to perform communicative, educative and social functions: it engages the public in literary and political discussions, thereby encouraging participation in 'the Arts' and promoting associated civic benefits. The audience of the literary festival, however, is typically represented as a body of populist and popularizing consumers, uncritically engaging with the mass-culture produced and propagated in the festival setting. Researchers have begun to refute such claims, demonstrating that members of festival audiences exhibit a deep and critical engagement with literature; but beyond this demographic-based research, little work has been conducted capable of interrogating audience experience, or mapping the broader culture of festival attendance. The diversity of literary festivals' sizes, locations, histories and stated goals is complemented by the equally broad ranges of programmed events. These events - and the festivals more broadly - are at once literary, theatrical, political and contemporary. As such, conceptions of audience, reader and readership from book history, communication and media studies, and performance and theatre studies, can all contribute to an investigation of the experience of the literary festival audience. This research compares work from these areas of study with individuals' personal accounts of festival experiences extracted from online weblogs to begin to conceptualise the variety and complexity of audience experiences at the literary festival, and outline the rich potential for further study in this area.","Monash Univ, Sch Literatures Languages Cultures & Linguist, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia","Weber, M (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Literatures Languages Cultures & Linguist, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",millicent.weber@monash.edu,"Weber, Millicent/AAC-1446-2020","Weber, Millicent/0000-0002-8063-5676",,,,53,10,10,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1030-4312,1469-3666,,CONTINUUM-J MEDIA CU,Continuum-J.

During those years, she forged a permanent bond with Kenya, where she managed a coffee plantation. This bond was immortalised in the book, leading to cult status for both the publication and its author. Out of Africa contains a blend of the essay, the sketch and the historical document. A contemporary reading of the book also reveals some offensive and racist passages; footprints, as it were, of the settler society of its day. However, the lyrical, introspective quality of this book has resulted in its becoming one of the great publishing phenomena of the twentieth century, reaching many readers through various reprints, translations and a film version. This article presents the publishing history of Out of Africa and gives an overview of its many translations across the globe. It also indicates the extent to which, and the reasons why, the book did (or did not) achieve success in Africa. A comparison is also made between Out of Africa and a number of texts by other female writers who wrote about their experiences particularly in African landscapes and/or places.","[Marais, Johann Lodewyk] Univ Pretoria, Unit Acad Literacy, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa","Marais, JL (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Unit Acad Literacy, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",JLMarais@yahoo.com,,"Marais, Johann Lodewyk/0000-0002-1587-1736",,,,60,0,0,0,9,UNIV PRETORIA,PRETORIA,"TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE ASSOC, FAC ECONOMIC & MANAGEMENT SCIENCES, GW-HSB 15-28 HUMANITIES BLDG, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",0041-476X,,,TYDSKR LETT,Tydskr.

Until now, there is neither a complete overview nor a bibliographical analysis of all Dutch and French editions that came on the market in the Low Countries. It is perhaps for this reason that very little research has been done on the history of the reception of the Qur'an in the Low Countries. This contribution will therefore offer the complete edition history of early printed translations of the Qur'an from the Low Countries, until the year 1800. With this overview I hope to contribute to the study of the reception of the Qur'an in the Low Countries and to instigate further cultural historical exploration into this interesting topic.","[den Hollander, August] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","den Hollander, A (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.a.den.hollander@vu.nl,,,,,,45,2,2,0,0,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0014-9527,1570-0690,,QUAERENDO,Quaerendo,,2015,45,3-4,,,,,209,239,,10.1163/15700690-12341328,,,31,Literature,Literature,DC2WY,WOS:000369080700002,,,,,2020-08-21,

This movement spread rapidly through Europe between 1820 and 1870, and Leerssen considers the 'long tail' and 'the banal' of 'national romanticism' mainly as phenomena of the twentieth century. As the history of national romanticism and the historical novel seem inseparable, this article compares Leerssen's definition and periodization with data on the historical novels that appeared in the Netherlands between 1790 and 1899. The data affirms Leerssen's periodization, but only with respect to the leading (protestant bourgeois) cultural class. An examination of all historical novels in the period 1790-1899 shows that the historical novel as consumer art was not restricted to the 'the long tail' and that around 1870 a Catholic form of national romanticism came into being. In a nutshell, the history of the historical novel in the nineteenth century reflects fundamental changes in Dutch political ideals in the same period: from homogeneous nation state to 'unity in diversity'.","[Streng, Toos] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Geesteswetenschappen, Capaciteitsgrp Geschiedenis, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Streng, T (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Fac Geesteswetenschappen, Capaciteitsgrp Geschiedenis, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",toos.streng@hetnet.nl,,,,,,59,0,0,0,0,WOLTERS-NOORDHOFF B V,GRONINGEN,"BOX 58, 9700 GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS",0040-7518,,,TIJDSCHR GESCHIEDEN,Tijdschr.

This essay seeks to demonstrate that this is an important testimony of the fall of the Ming Dynasty in 1644, in the context of other Western accounts of that event. It also shows the worldwide effect of the Manchu invasion over China and the perception of historical crisis, as he observedin his textwritten in New Spain during the Dynasty's transition. Lastly, the essay tries to analyze the participation of Archbishop Palafox on the controversy regarding Jesuit methods in the evangelization of China. The involvement of Palafox in the Rites Controversy was due to his pastoral role in Mexico and his duties in connection with Asia, accordingly with the Patronato Real. The work of Palafox shows also the viewpoint of a statesman's observer of the global trends occurring during this problematic time.

Authors or editors sometimes manipulated or revised important sections, for instance omitting a statement on predestination or adding a discourse on the immortality of the soul, illustrating the Jesuits' strategy of balancing the Japanese and the European-Catholic intellectual climates of their time.

J,"Young, S",,,,"Young, Sandra",,,Early modern geography and the construction of a knowable Africa,ATLANTIC STUDIES-GLOBAL CURRENTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,early modern geography; global south; alterity; representations of Africa; Leo Africanus; book history,,"Africa was integral to the early modern preoccupation with being able to account for the whole world in seemingly scholarly fashion. The Africa that took shape in early modern geographies was not imagined in isolation: its cultural geography was linked to other regions of the world in a comparative system that helped to distinguish between the barbarous and those worthy to be called human, and between the Southern Nations and the Northern People. It contributed to the emergence of a global south, made explicit through the language of cartography, which allowed early modern readers to gain their bearings in a more complex world. I examine some early scholarly representations of Africa in English, to reflect on the role of textual structure in constructing Africa as an object of knowledge, a place of strangeness and possibility. Editorial interventions transform inherited associations between Africa and barbarism, I argue, and between nomadism and  beastliness, and subject them to new evidentiary strictures. Even so, these myths appear as a watermark in the later texts' adjudication of what it means to be human. To understand how early modern geographers understood the ambit of their work, and the implications for Africa, I examine three texts spanning a little over a 100 years, in 50-year steps: William Prat's Discription of the Contrey of Aphrique (1554), Pory's edition of Leo Africanus's A Geographical Historie (1600), and Richard Blome's 1682 English-language edition of Bernadus Varenius's Geographia Generalis, which sought to describe the discipline itself. In the account of Africa by Leo Africanus, a self-identified African, a more complex version of Africa entered the discourse. Scholars have presented Leo Africanus as a mediator between worlds, but his own speaking posture is complicated by the disciplinary structures shaping his narrative and the controlling presence of John Pory as partisan compiler and translator. Similarly, Blome's framing of Varenius's Geographia in 1682 establishes a set of equivalences across the  Southern Nations that derive meaning in relation to their  Northern opposites. Through the language of cardinal points and demonstrable experience, Africa in the seventeenth century emerges as knowable and inhabitable, but steeped in old stigmas.",,,Sandra.Young@uct.ac.za,,,Helen Watson Buckner Memorial Research Fellowship at Brown University,"Sandra Young is a Senior Lecturer and Convener of the Masters Program in the English Department at the University of Cape Town.

Even partial collections like the one at the University of Victoria have enough rare books to serve these purposes. But how do we teach book culture and intellectual history when we do not have multiple or even representative books from many authors, countries, and sometimes whole decades? We adopt a curatorial teaching model that invites students to find, select, and chart a narrative through the materials that we do have. This article describes our curatorial projects in the hope that others will undertake similar endeavours. It also explains how the very partiality of our collection has generated wonderful opportunities for students to learn not just book history but also the history of Canadian universities, libraries, collectors, and Renaissance studies.","[Jenstad, Janelle; Kelly, Erin E.] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada","Jenstad, J (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION,TORONTO,"C/O CRRS, 71 QUEENS PARK CRESCENT EAST, TORONTO, ON M5S 1K7, CANADA",0034-429X,,,RENAISSANCE REFORM,Renaiss.

It explores to what extent and with what effect traces of editorial mediation revealed in publishers' archives can be written into the history of francophone African literature. Fall's long-neglected text is one of the earliest francophone African novels of post-independence disillusionment. Described by an early critic as the first African existentialist novel, its fragmented narrative draws on seams of poetic symbolism, burlesque comedy, and philosophical reflection to portray a vagrant protagonist. The complex structure and unstable narrative voice mark a departure from realist modes of African novels in the 1950s. Moreover it troubles any reductive account of a linear transition from realism to modernism. Yet Fall's work remains much less known than the celebrated stylistic innovation of Ahmadou Kourouma's Les Soleils des independances (1968) or Yambo Ouologuem's Le Devoir de violence (1968). Readers' reports at Le Seuil, a publisher with clear anti-colonial sympathies, show how editors sought to revise Fall's manuscript according to normative ideas of language, genre, and literary craft, tentatively pointing to the text's modernist leanings without fully articulating what such modernity might constitute or imply. While clearly not exclusive to African or postcolonial literature, such stylistic tempering (or tampering) arguably shaped the text's meditations on trauma, freedom, and alienation. This evidence leads to a revised, multivalent understanding of Fall's literary innovation.","Univ Westminster, London W1B 2UW, England","Bush, R (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, 309 Regent St, London W1B 2UW, England.",r.bush@westminster.ac.uk,,,,,,63,1,1,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0021-9894,1741-6442,,J COMMONW LIT,J.

The point of departure for this paper is the twofold analogy (analogy of content, analogy of medium) between printed and electronic books, the aim being to draw attention to the usual perception of their capacities and relationships, to provide a rather detailed analysis of the outcome and sustainability of such analogies and ultimately to indicate the drawbacks involved. Method. The contextual analysis of contents of the key themes is employed; in the articulation of the conclusions, analytic and synthetic approaches are used. Results. The definitions of the e-book are not consensual or sustainable, rather reflect the current developmental phase of the phenomenon. The emphasis is placed upon changes, and continuity is ignored, and it is not seen that the possibility of analogies derives from a long historical development. While the analogy of content is sustainable, for it implies the reproduction of the same discourses in different media, analogy of medium is not, for the interactive capacities permitted by the printed and the electronic medium are different. Conclusions. The e-book discourse has to be expanded by understandings drawn from cognate areas such as book history, publishing studies and in general by those from the extremely useful insights employed in the cultural-historical approach, for all the media functioning in any given period coexist and affect each other.","Univ Osijek, Dept Informat Sci, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Osijek, Croatia","Velagic, Z (corresponding author), Univ Osijek, Dept Informat Sci, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Osijek, Croatia.",zvelagic@ffos.hr,,,,,,40,4,4,0,22,UNIV SHEFFIELD DEPT INFORMATION STUDIES,SHEFFIELD,"UNIV SHEFFIELD, WESTERN BANK, SHEFFIELD S10 2TN, S YORKS, ENGLAND",1368-1613,,,INFORM RES,Inf.

Although missionaries did indeed establish schools and introduce various kinds of literacy, there is a much longer history of the book in various parts of the continent. This essay looks at some of the recent work that focuses on the use of the Arabic script in Africa. Although the field of Islam in Africa has framed this work, it is necessary to see the uses of this literacy within the frame of the history of the book and related fields. The works discussed are rich in content and analysis and provide the opening for new initiatives on the content of the literacy and the methods of teaching and reading, but also the materiality of the book and the formation of the archive.","[Jeppie, Shamil] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa","Jeppie, S (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0018-2656,1468-2303,,HIST THEORY,Hist.

The Bartholomew Archive, in Edinburgh, has proved to be an exceptionally rich source of hitherto unexamined data on the business and personal activities of one of the leading producers of school atlases, the local firm of John Bartholomew and Son, which was active in map making and publishing between 1880 and 1987. The sociology and pattern of communication of publishing, explored by book historians and historians of science, geography and cartography in other contexts, are here considered in relation to the atlases that were produced in Britain for schools in the United Kingdom and in other parts of the Empire in the period 1880-1930. Particular attention is paid to the efforts of mapmakers, publishers, geographers and other professionals to ensure the relevance of the maps selected in school atlases for specific audiences, to guarantee the credibility of the information communicated through these atlases, and to negotiate questions of authorship.","[McDougall-Waters, Julie] Univ St Andrews, Sch Hist, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; [McDougall-Waters, Julie] Royal Soc, London SW1Y 5AG, England","McDougall-Waters, J (corresponding author), Royal Soc, Ctr Hist Sci, 6-9 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AG, England.",jm281@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,,,,28,1,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5694,1479-7801,,IMAGO MUNDI,Imago Mundi,JAN 2,2014,66,1,,,,,82,U80,,10.1080/03085694.2014.845954,,,14,Geography; History; History & Philosophy Of Science; History Of Social Sciences,Geography; History; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics,259GB,WOS:000327514300005,,,,,2020-08-21,

These themes are drawn together in a discussion of the 'imperial commons'.

Parker published editions of some of these texts, and his editorial prefaces yield valuable information about his aims and methods. By situating Parker's own explanation of his activities within the context of a textual community that reached back to include medieval ecclesiastics, we see that he learned much from medieval textual practices. Parker and his circle emulated key features of the reading habits, methods of selection and compilation, and scribal practices they saw in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. Though conscious of the linguistic distance between his Anglo-Saxon manuscripts and his readers, Parker nevertheless exploited his bridging of that distance to support the ecclesiastical and political aims of Elizabeth's early reign. Medieval and early modern treatments of the art of memory provide an important framework, within which Parker may be seen to be reimagining a sort of remembered medieval past for the young Church of England.","John Carroll Univ, University Hts, OH 44118 USA","Butler, E (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA.",ebutler@jcu.edu,,,,,,42,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0028-2677,1572-8668,,NEOPHILOLOGUS,Neophilologus,JAN,2014,98,1,,,,,145,159,,10.1007/s11061-013-9368-y,,,15,Language & Linguistics; Literature,Linguistics; Literature,284IV,WOS:000329310600010,,,,,2020-08-21,

Research that followed in the 1980s and 1990s is linked together for the first time. Seven projects are suggested for current researchers to undertake so they can assess the utility of earlier research ideas that did not get a proper chance for development.

Second, documents pertaining to the realization in print of Villa's stories and his book are analyzed as sites of negotiations between colonial subject (Villa) and the colonial master (his American editors and publishers). Finally, an account of how Villa was made to circulate in the Philippines after the publication of his stories and his book in the United States is given. From these discussions the article hopes to show that Villa's self-fashioning by publication was both subject to and critical of the colonial condition, alternately reinforcing it and challenging it.","Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies, Manila, Philippines","Chua, J (corresponding author), Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies, Manila, Philippines.",jchua@ateneo.edu,,,,,,88,0,0,0,1,ATENEO DE MANILA UNIV,QUEZON CITY,"SCH HUMANITIES, DEPT ENGLISH, LOYOLA HEIGHTS, QUEZON CITY, 1108, PHILIPPINES",2094-6937,,,KRIT KULT,Krit.

Thus I include a presentation of the contexts in which the textbooks I study are published, and I analyse textbooks content revealing different approaches to present the notion of temperature. I argue that these results show that textbooks are valuable sources to investigate public representations of science and their shift over time, and I conclude by stressing the parallel of this evolution with change in everyday relationship with science and scientific instruments.","Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Ctr Alexandre Koyre, Paris, France","Radtka, C (corresponding author), Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Ctr Alexandre Koyre, Paris, France.",catherine.radtka@gmail.com,,,,,,38,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-7220,1573-1901,,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

Drawing on extensive research in Random House archives at the Columbia Rare Book and Manuscript Library, this essay uses a book-history approach to show that the Modern Library contributed to the blurring of boundaries between modernist and popular fiction.","Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Faillant, L (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,,"Jaillant, Lise/0000-0002-2680-4571",,,,147,0,0,0,0,UNIV TULSA,TULSA,"800 SOUTH TUCKER DR, TULSA, OK 74104 USA",0021-4183,1938-6036,,JAMES JOYCE QUART,James Joyce Q.,SPR,2013,50,3,,,,,767,+,,,,,30,"Literature, British Isles",Literature,V38VJ,WOS:000209370600017,,,,,2020-08-21,

What scholarship there has been has insisted that scientific part-works operated on entirely different principles from the strategies for maintaining readerly interest that were being developed by serial novelists like Charles Dickens. Deploying the methods of book history, this essay examines the reporting of Richard Owen's celebrated paleontological reconstructions from the 1830s and 1840s in the serialized formats of the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, his own History of British Fossil Mammals, and, in particular, the Penny Cyclopaedia. It argues that Owen, along with his close friend William John Broderip, clearly recognized the affective possibilities of the serial format and that they exploited the Penny Cyclopaedia's sequential mode of publication to evoke suspense and expectation in their anonymous but collaboratively authored accounts of Owen's paleontological researches.","[Dawson, Gowan] Univ Leicester, Sch English, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Dawson, Gowan] Univ Leicester, Victorian Studies Ctr, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Dawson, G (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Sch English, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",,,,,,,95,5,6,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0021-1753,,,ISIS,Isis,DEC,2012,103,4,,,,,637,667,,10.1086/668961,,,31,History & Philosophy Of Science,History & Philosophy of Science,088IM,WOS:000314827500001,23488235,,,,2020-08-21,

Europe achieved the highest development in economy, education, military and other fields. Eastern intellectuals and state officials endeavored to benefit from European methods for the development of their own countries. Emin Abid was one in this regard. Emin Abid born in 1898 in Baku was graduated from Istanbul University in 1926. Having returned to his home country-Azerbaijan he started teaching in the universities and lyceums and published his articles on history of literature in the magazines. His creative activity was related to the writing of history of the literature based on new method-European method which is reflected in all his articles and in his many-volumed book History of Literature of Azerbaijani Turks. Each nation in Europe had formed its own government and was living within that government. The situation was different in the East. The Turks were living within several governments such as in Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan, Iraq and others. This situation prevented the research of literature history of the nation from geographical perspective in both Turkey and Azerbaijan. Though the Turks were majority in Azerbaijan the minor nations such as Talishs, Lezgis, Avars, Kurds, Armenians, Russians and others should not be disregarded. The research of history of Azerbaijani literature needed to be multilingual. For this reason Emin Abid decided to write the history of literature of Azerbaijani Turks. He was not writing only about the history of the literature of the Turks in Azerbaijan but also about the Turks who shared the same accent with the ones in Azerbaijan. It was against the Soviet strategy. The ban over the publishing of his books came in 1936 leading to his relieve of his duty in 1937. In 1938 Emin Abid was arrested and having been interrogated for a while he was executed. The first volume of his many-volumed book History of Literature of Azerbaijani Turks is kept in Azerbaijan State Literature and Art Archive whereas the last volume is kept in Istanbul Darulfun (Istanbul University). His manuscripts, published and unpublished articles are best indicators to be related while talking about the research method on the history of the literature of Azerbaijani Turks.","Azerbaijan Natl Sci Acad Inst Folklore, Dept Int Relat, Baku, Azerbaijan","Huseyinoglu, AS (corresponding author), Azerbaijan Natl Sci Acad Inst Folklore, Dept Int Relat, Baku, Azerbaijan.",alishamil@yahoo.com,,,,,,40,0,0,0,1,AHMET YESEVI UNIV,BAHCELIEVLER,"MUTEVELLI HEYET BASKANLIGI, TASKENT CADDESI 10 SOK NU 30, BAHCELIEVLER, ANKARA 06490, TURKEY",1301-0549,,,BILIG,Bilig,WIN,2012,,60,,,,,169,191,,,,,23,Area Studies,Area Studies,920MF,WOS:000302408000008,,,,,2020-08-21,

In light of this distance, this essay is inspired by two primary objectives. The first is to cast light on Frye's treatment of the book as a material artefact, a theme that has received relatively little attention. The second is to draw attention to the important role of the material book as metaphor in Frye's writings, and consider its implications for the practice of book history. Working against prevailing stereotypes of both Frye's visionary humanism and book history, this essay attempts to bridge the two by considering how books as physical artefacts participate in the work of the imagination. I argue that Frye's attentiveness to the socially symbolic power of the book, and his various explorations of the metaphorical possibilities of this artefact, provide powerful instances of how cultural meanings of media of inscription signify alongside their verbal contents.","Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Decook, T (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",,,,,,,14,0,0,0,5,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0042-0247,1712-5278,,U TORONTO QUART,Univ.

The core subject of this discipline is the concept of user-oriented organization of knowledge; it has a close connection to information-seeking behavior and retrieval. By studying the typographic arrangement of knowledge in early printed reference works, one can approach the history of the storage, organization, and retrieval of scientific information. The article discusses the typographic architecture of the dictionaries published by the Antwerp printer Christophe Plantin and, more specifically, the three dictionaries of the Dutch language compiled by Plantin's learned proofreader Cornelis Kiliaan (ca. 1530-1607). Kiliaan was one of the first authors to introduce etymology and comparative linguistics into his dictionaries. By analyzing the typographic macrostructures and microstructures of his works, it is possible to discover the lines along which they developed-in the words of Paul Valery-into machines a savoir. The article also compares Plantin's dictionaries with the international benchmark for lexicographic publishing in the Renaissance world, viz, the translation dictionaries compiled and printed by the Parisian publisher Robert Estienne.","[Delsaerdt, Pierre] Univ Antwerp, Lib & Informat Sci Program, Antwerp, Belgium; [Delsaerdt, Pierre] Cent Univ Lib, Louvain, Belgium; [Delsaerdt, Pierre] Flanders Heritage Lib, Antwerp, Belgium","Delsaerdt, P (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.",,,,,,,30,0,0,0,15,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0024-2594,1559-0682,,LIBR TRENDS,Libr.

The conceptual and spatial structure of knowledge is materialized in the library (book repository or book series). Libraries are meeting places and crossroads of bibliomigrancy (Mani) of works having various geographical and historical origins as well as the places that allow us to establish cognitive and creative interferences between cultural spaces inscribed in the library holdings. Books evoke a variety of imaginary spatial models, including the global, while their own spaces are also physical and meaningful. From its beginnings up to the present expansion of digital textuality the medium of the book appears in the context of economies, which set the direction and breadth of the spatial reach of the messages it transmits and encodes.

The author makes a suggestion that it is necessary to supplement an examination of 20th-century aesthetics by a panoramic view of international cooperation (International aesthetic congresses and Associations). The book provides an opportunity for a reflection on the destiny of aesthetics, which is in search of an understanding of contemporary artistic culture and which itself loses its traditional status in interaction with other fields of knowledge.

Translating anglophone African literature in the world republic of letters,JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL WRITING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Chinua Achebe; Amos Tutuola; world literature; translation; France; authorship; publishing,,"This article considers translations of African texts from English to French in the context of recent conceptualizations of world literature as a critical approach. Translation is a key mechanism, dynamic and metaphor in world literature. However, its idealized connotations should not distract from the material realities of a process governed by uneven structures of production and reception. Two cases are illustrative: Amos Tutuola's L'Ivrogne dans la brousse (The Palm-Wine Drinkard) (trans. Raymond Queneau 1953; 1952) and Chinua Achebe's Le Monde s'effondre (Things Fall Apart) (trans. Michel Ligny 1966; 1958) published respectively by Gallimard and Presence Africaine. The rapturous mainstream reception of Raymond Queneau's stylistic appropriation of Tutuola is here contrasted with the subdued reception of Achebe's text in France in the late 1960s. The translators' spectral presence in text and paratext is key to understanding the position of the translated texts in relation to the aesthetic, political and commercial stakes of their publishing contexts. Colonial and postcolonial book history thus confirms the material instability and relationality of any totalizing model of a world literary system and the methodological limits of a singular abstract concept of world literary time or space.","Univ Oxford Wolfson Coll, Oxford OX2 6UD, England","Bush, R (corresponding author), Univ Oxford Wolfson Coll, Oxford OX2 6UD, England.",ruth.bush@wolfson.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,64,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1744-9855,1744-9863,,J POSTCOLONIAL WRIT,J.

The mundane itemization of male clothing, I argue, does not merely pit the everyday against Gothic improbability. The washing bill plot invites readers to reflect critically on courtship plots and their own emotional investment in happy endings. By drawing attention to the papers' appearance, content, and location, Austen uses the washing bills as evidence for how courtship novels and readers' affective expectations repress the material facts central to both marriage and novel reading: men and books have bodies. The complex interplay of surface and depth that characterizes the washing bill plot is central to Austen's quest to devise a form for the novel that engages the reader both critically and emotionally. By linking the washing bills to the novel's other jarring reminders of the materiality of books and reading, this article makes the broader claim that a full understanding of the form of eighteenth-century novels requires combining the methods of formalism and book history.","Oberlin Coll, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA","Baudot, L (corresponding author), Oberlin Coll, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA.",,,,,,,23,1,1,0,1,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0840-6286,1911-0243,,EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY F,Eighteenth-Century Fict.,WIN,2011,24,2,,,,,325,352,,10.3138/ecf.24.2.325,,,28,Literature,Literature,884NT,WOS:000299715500009,,,,,2020-08-21,

Through assessment of archival and printed evidence relating to the authorship and editing of books of travel and exploration published by the leading British publisher, John Murray, the paper examines the redactive relationships between writer and editor-publisher, illustrates the means by which authors sought status in their words and explores how Murray authorised explorers' words and works. In addressing the complex connections between author and editor, manuscript and print, private correspondence and public audience, the paper has implications for researchers in geography interested in the specific relationships between writing and print, and in the general connections between geography, book history and the history of science.","[Withers, Charles W.

We know the names of five of the women who bought books at local auctions, as well as the titles of the books, but why did they choose these particular titles? In what way do the books reflect the interests of the reader? Only 5 out of a total of 154 printed auction catalogues have a woman's name on the title page. In this article, I examine whether there are reasons for believing that the five women had a closer relation to the books for sale than did their many anonymous sisters whose late husbands' books were sold at other auctions. Finally, I examine what six women wrote about their own reading, five of them farming women belonging to a revival movement. I show that women with an active interest in books came from very different walks of life, from the upper classes as well as farming society. What they had in common was an interest in religious books, especially works by pietistic authors. While these women limited themselves to this theme, as far as we can tell from examined sources, upper class women also read a wider selection of subjects, although the modern novel was not as popular as one might have expected.

I argue that more research on women's reading is necessary if the different ideas, thoughts and knowledge women were privy to are to be fully realised.

The shift in design methodology, which was recognized and interpreted by Zevi through accomplishments of selected architects, emerged for the first time in the works of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Better understanding of the wider context of this architectural development was made by chronological tables of prominent scientific and artistic contributions at the end of the book.

In her book History After Apartheid: Visual Culture and Public Memory in a Democratic South Africa, Annie Coombes remarks, 'Women's vital role in the overthrow of the apartheid state has been sorely neglected in favour of a more monolithic representation of the liberation movement'.(1) In this paper I consider Coombes's claim in relation to one specific attempt at public memorial after apartheid: the Monument to the Women of South Africa located at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. As the only commemorative site dedicated entirely to women's apartheid-era political efforts, the Monument to the Women of South Africa is of vital importance to the memory of women's role in the struggle; and yet a tension exists between the monument's presence as a feminist site, and its disappearance from public view: the Monument has essentially been invisible to the public for most of its existence, due in part to the inaccessibility of the Union Buildings. The Monument's invisibility not only trivialises the political significance of the Women's March, but is also a distressing act of post-apartheid erasure of women's political agency. I argue that when one considers this alongside the more widespread exclusion of women in post-apartheid commemorative sites, this not only has implications for the telling of history, but may very well affect women's ability, in Cynthia Enloe's words, to 'sustain an authentic political life in post-war periods'.(2)","Wheaton Coll, Norton, MA 02766 USA","Miller, K (corresponding author), Wheaton Coll, Norton, MA 02766 USA.",miller_kim@wheatoncollege.edu,,,,,,55,8,8,0,8,UNISA PRESS,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-2473,1726-1686,,S AFR HIST J,S.-Afr.

Where Rainey values zones of textual transmission and an author's role therein, Bornstein values the craft of book-making and the bibliographic codes they support that pay homage to aesthetic tradition. These two critical dispositions have had a crucial impact on the particular reception of Pound's engagement with the Italian Renaissance by quite differently intimating Pound's relationship with the culture and politics of Italian fascism. By paying close attention to an overlooked aspect of Pound's Italian Renaissance in 'Canto XXX', an interpolated letter from the Venetian printer, Hieronymus Soncinus, as well as letters written to Pound found at the Lilly Library from Nancy Clara Cunard as she worked as his research assistant in Italy, discovering manuscripts that would be germane to his rendering of the figure of Sigismondo Malatesta, I offer an argument that extends Bornstein's belief in Pound's commitment to a decidedly socialist politics, a commitment that necessarily has him at odds with the usual practices of avant-garde abstention theorised by Pierre Bourdieu in The Rules of Art.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0950-236X,,,TEXTUAL PRACT,Textual Pract.,,2011,25,3,,,,,543,+,,10.1080/0950236X.2010.510887,,,21,Literature,Literature,886EI,WOS:000299834600008,,,,,2020-08-21,

The shift between these cultures has arguably been the result of diverse technological innovations, with each altering the ways in which the spoken/written word came to be recorded and received. As a result, practices of writing and reading have varied historically in accordance with the material carriers available for the storage and retrieval of information. If media technologies (from the human body to the computer) make a difference to practices of writing and reading, as historians of the book have demonstrated, then surely the same technologies have also made a difference to practices of translation. I therefore ask what role media technology has played in the history of translation, and what kinds of practices of translation can be associated with different media cultures.","Univ Essex, Dept Literature Film & Theatre Studies, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","Littau, K (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Dept Literature Film & Theatre Studies, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",klittau@essex.ac.uk,,"Littau, Karin/0000-0002-9304-295X",,,,71,26,26,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1478-1700,1751-2921,,TRANSL STUD,Transl.

Building on this premise, we explore theoretical affinities shared by recent design and book history scholarship, and connect those theories to the emerging practice of peer-reviewing digital objects in scholarly contexts. We suggest a checklist for subjecting prototypes directly to peer review: Is the argument reified by the prototype contestable, defensible, and substantive? Does the prototype have a recognizable position in the context of similar work, either in terms of concept or affordances? Is the prototype part of a series of prototypes with an identifiable trajectory? Does the prototype address possible objections? Is the prototype itself an original contribution to knowledge? We also outline some implications for funding agencies interested in supporting researchers who are designing experimental computer prototypes. For instance, if a series of prototypes functions as a set of smaller arguments within a larger debate, it might be more appropriate to fund the sequence rather than treating each project as an individual proposal.","[Galey, Alan] Univ Toronto, Fac Informat, Book Hist & Print Culture Program, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Ruecker, Stan] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada","Galey, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Informat, Book Hist & Print Culture Program, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",alan.galey@utoronto.ca,"Ruecker, Stan/B-6609-2016","Ruecker, Stan/0000-0003-0099-1687",,,,63,37,38,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0268-1145,1477-4615,,LIT LINGUIST COMPUT,Lit.

Historians and literary scholars have engaged with a number of questions about the impact of changes in technology on reading practices and particularly on the relationship between new technologies of reading and writing and social, religious, and political change. The new field of the history of the book, merging aspects of social and intellectual history with the tools of analytical and descriptive bibliography, came to the fore in the second half of the twentieth century at the same time that the emergence of new forms of electronic media raised many questions for social scientists about the ways that technological change have affected aspects of human communication in our time. Meanwhile, while the field of book history emerged initially among early modernists interested in the impact of printing technology, the issues raised regarding authorship, publication, relations between orality and the written word, dissemination, and reception have enriched the study of earlier periods.","Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Shear, A (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,"Shear, Adam/0000-0001-8241-1783",,,,15,0,0,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0364-0094,1475-4541,,AJS REV,AJS Rev.,NOV,2010,34,2,,,,,353,357,,10.1017/S0364009410000371,,,5,History; Religion,History; Religion,696UJ,WOS:000285466600008,,,,,2020-08-21,

It is known that between the Romanian culture and the culture of the South-Slavic peoples there was a strong connection. The first printed books from Targoviste (1508-1512), executed by the monk Macarie, spread in the Slavic world, being used as a model for the books printed in this space. The relations of the Romanian written culture with the other cultures in South-eastern Europe manifested on several plans: the printing activity was in a constant evolution, printers, proofreaders, engravers or bookbinders coming to work in the Romanian principalities, the same way as the Romanian craftsmen produced manuscripts and books for the Balkan communities or even traveled to remote places to set up printing workshops.","[Erich, Agnes] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Fac Humanities, Targoviste, Romania",,agnes_erich@yahoo.com,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",,,978-960-474-205-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,168,173,,,,,6,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Social Sciences - Other Topics,BXP30,WOS:000296596800025,,,,,2020-08-21,

Comic books and graphic novels are no exception to this trend. Despite this, these media have received comparatively little attention from criminal justice scholars. This chapter seeks to explore the depiction of crime and justice in modern-era comic books and graphic novels. Methodology/approach - Content analysis techniques were used to examine 166 individual comic books from the modern age (mid-1980s to present), including those compiled in graphic novel form. Particular emphasis was placed on issues of crime control and due process. Findings - Clear criminal justice themes were seen across the sample, including an emphasis on crime control and crime prevention. Further, comic books featuring the individual characters of Superman and Batman portrayed opposing conceptions of justice such as justified/unjustified use of force and a willingness to follow or break the law. Research limitations This research represents an exploration of the depiction of crime-related themes in comic books and graphic novels, but is by no means definitive. It would be useful to extend this research by examining other eras in comic book history, as well as oilier comic book characters and publishing companies. Practical implications - The public's perceptions of the criminal justice system ultimately affect societal views of the legitimacy of the system. Since legitimacy is a requisite for compliance, it is important to understand,factors that may influence these perceptions. These may include comic books, graphic novels, and other popular media. Originality/value of paper - Comic books stories and themes have long reflected the times. However, it is unclear how crime and the criminal justice system are portrayed in the comic book world. This chapter is an attempt to fill a gap in the extant literature by examining this often neglected form of popular media.","[Reyns, Bradford W.] So Utah Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Criminal Justice, Cedar City, UT 84720 USA; [Henson, Billy] Univ Cincinnati, Sch Criminal Justice, Cincinnati, OH USA","Reyns, BW (corresponding author), So Utah Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Criminal Justice, Cedar City, UT 84720 USA.",,"Reyns, Bradford W./I-8853-2019",,,,,27,5,5,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1521-6136,,978-1-84950-732-5,SOCIOL CRIME LAW DEV,,,2010,14,,,,,,45,66,,10.1108/S1521-6136(2010)0000014006,,,22,Criminology & Penology; Sociology,Criminology & Penology; Sociology,BYU89,WOS:000300563500004,,,,,2020-08-21,

Instead of mining the stories of Apuleius and Boccaccio for exemplary social types or for information about the social meanings of past sex acts, this essay uses philological and paratextual materials to focalize these tales' interpretive erotics, complicate the temporal relations between them, and model a way of studying the history of sexuality that is not tied to a history of social types, identities, or acts.

What is less well appreciated is that Butterfield powerfully argued in his 1951 book History and Human Relations that there was no prospect of state leaders and diplomats overcoming the dynamics of mutual suspicion and distrust that created what he had chosen to call a condition of 'Hobbesian fear'. Herz parted company with Butterfield on this fundamental question, considering that two adversaries could come to appreciate that what they perceived as the other's hostile behaviour was a defensive response to their own actions. This article revisits this fundamental question that divided the pioneer theorists of the security dilemma as to whether better mutual understanding between potential rivals might be the key to mitigating fear-based hostility. The article discusses this question in relation to Herz's ideas about surviving the nuclear age, and shows how he believed that knowledge of the security dilemma was critical if the superpowers were to mitigate their security competition. Having examined how far the end of the Cold War supports Herz's position, the article concludes by showing how Herz became increasingly disillusioned that the United States was capable of acting to mitigate the security dilemma in the post-Cold War world.","[Wheeler, Nicholas J.] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Int Polit, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Wheeler, Nicholas J.] Aberystwyth Univ, David Davies Mem Inst Int Studies, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales","Wheeler, NJ (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Int Polit, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",,,,,,,62,16,16,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0047-1178,1741-2862,,INT RELAT,Int.

J,"Komaromi, A",,,,"Komaromi, Ann",,,Samizdat as Extra-Gutenberg Phenomenon,POETICS TODAY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article proposes to treat samizdat in terms of a textual culture opposed to modern print culture. The choice to cast samizdat as an extra-Gutenberg phenomenon represents a way of extending the observation that samizdat can no longer simply be defined as the mouthpiece of dissident opposition. Beyond binary oppositions of truth vs. falsehood, and dissidents vs. state, on which previous perceptions of samizdat have depended, we might now see the essential quality of samizdat to be its exemplification of epistemic instability, inasmuch as samizdat texts are not automatically invested with authority. From this perspective, new questions about the production, distribution, and reproduction of samizdat texts with varying types of content turn on a central issue: how was the trustworthiness or value of such texts established? This article explores these issues through personal testimony about the production and circulation of samizdat in the USSR and in the West. Juxtaposing the theory of gift giving with new critical approaches to book history, textual culture, and bibliography, the article aims to highlight the interest of personal testimony and material texts in a critical analysis of samizdat history. Finally, as a striking example of an epistemically unstable textual culture, samizdat represents not merely opposition to a defunct political system: it also exemplifies issues relevant to a global Internet culture today.","Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada","Komaromi, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,72,15,15,0,5,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",0333-5372,,,POETICS TODAY,Poetics Today,WIN,2008,29,4,,,,,629,667,,10.1215/03335372-080,,,39,Literature,Literature,404XK,WOS:000263186100002,,,,,2020-08-21,

These artifacts increase the amount of material on which we base our conclusions, but one could argue that such texts offer more than simply evidence of literary production. Unfortunately, the tendency in the new field of the history of the book to define book as being a printed object threatens once again to marginalize women's participation in literary culture in the same way that previous models of literary history based on great man or spirit of the age did in previous generations. Using as a case study the newly recovered manuscript volume by Hester Pulter (1595/96-1678), this essay concludes by examining some premises about early modern women's participation in various aspects of literary culture as being exceptional, or anomalous, or whether instead we are still in the process of recovering the materials that would make such conclusions warranted.","Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Ezell, MJM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,72,16,16,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-8312,1475-6757,,ENGL LITERARY RENAIS,Engl.

He was, without doubt, the first to disseminate Buddhism in the Baltic countries and also one of the earliest disseminators of Buddhism in Eastern Europe. Karl August Tonisson, born in 1883 near Poltsamaa, Estonia, later repeatedly changed his biography (for example, transformed from an Estonian to a Latvian and simultaneously became ten years older). The article focuses on the development of his ideas. All his books and other publications, which are modest in volume and usually self-published, were issued between 1909-1916 and 1925-1930. The development of his views can be divided into three main periods: the pre-Buddhist period (before 1911); the 'theosophical Buddhist' period (1911-1916) and the period of ego-Buddhism or neopaganism (1925-1930). Around 1910-1911. Tennison ultimately converts to Buddhism. As he did not identify with any particular school, we may call him an 'abstract' Buddhist. In 1925 Tennison published a book in Latvian and from 1928 to 1930 three books in Estonian. In the publications of this period, Tennison retreats from the principles of Buddhism and allots more space to the glorification of his own personality and to criticism of Christianity, which was typical of neopaganism popular in Europe at the period. One of the most peculiar ideas in Tennison's books is that of the Pan-Baltonian Empire. In that period Tennison also began to disseminate his view that Estonians', Latvians' and Lithuanians' pre-Christian beliefs were somewhat similar to the religious and philosophical systems of India in the Vedic period, which, in the present-day world, are represented in their purest form in Buddhism. In 1930, Tennison, accompanied by Friedrich V. Lustig, left the Baltics and a year later also Europe, settling for the period 1932-1949 in the Kingdom of Siam. After leaving the Baltics, Tennison did not publish his texts as separate books, although during the last period of his life, in the 1950s and early 19608 while living in Burma, he is known to have been writing his so-called Buddhist Catechism, which remained unfinished.",,,maittalts@hot.ee,,,,,,178,4,4,0,1,ESTONIAN LITERARY MUSEUM,TARTU,"FOLK BELIEF & MEDIA GRP, VANEMUISE 42-235, TARTU, 51003, ESTONIA",1406-0957,,,FOLKLORE-EL J FOLKL,Folklore-Electron.

Superconductivity in quasi-two-dimensional ET compounds with the maximum T-c of 14.2 K, which is the highest among the organic superconductors to date, appears in the vicinity of Mott transition. The symmetry of Cooper pair, which reflects the mechanism of superconductivity, is of keen interest. In this chapter, we first review Mott transition in (ET)(2)X families as a key phenomenon for the emergence of superconductivity. Then, we describe the experimental status of the problem of pairing symmetry by reviewing NMR as well as other measurements probing the superconductive nature.

Jerome; theoretical and experimental reviews on the unconventional nature of superconductivity are given by A.G. Lebed and Si Wu, by R.W. Cherng, W.

There are significant debates within Dutch book history concerning its scholarly identity, scope of research, theoretical and methodological foundation, and its response to the electronic revolution. Although these discussions may be crucial for the vitality of the discipline, they should not lead to shortsightedness. just as important is the interaction and communication with other disciplines. Book historians should stress the relevance of their findings more, in order to foster 'book historical awareness' among other historians. There are at least three fields in which historians can profit from book historical studies. First, book historians provide critical insights into the use of printed books as historical sources. Second, by studying the book in all its economic, cultural, and religious aspects, book historians generate new and totally different historical questions. And last but not least, book historians bridge the gap between text-oriented scholars, such as literary historians and philosophers, on the one hand, and context-oriented historians on the other.","Univ Utrecht, VIDI, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Salman, J (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, VIDI, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,,,,,81,0,0,0,0,WOLTERS-NOORDHOFF B V,GRONINGEN,"BOX 58, 9700 GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS",0040-7518,,,TIJDSCHR GESCHIEDEN,Tijdschr.

The price of the texts included in the Jiaxing Tripitaka increased from the mid-seventeenth century onwards, as did the costs for transcribing and carving wood-blocks. Relative to the value of rice in the Yangzi Delta from 1589 to 1715, the value of a volume of the Tripitaka generally rose. Yet the relative value of a book is not the same as its affordability, which is determined by the book's price, its value relative to other commodities, the real income of the purchaser, and other economic and non-economic elements. It is hoped that this investigation will contribute new views to the history of books in late imperial China.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England","Dai, LB (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,,,,113,2,2,0,3,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0082-5433,,,TOUNG PAO,Toung Pao,,2008,94,4-5,,,,,306,359,,10.1163/008254308X385888,,,54,Asian Studies,Asian Studies,391WJ,WOS:000262264600003,,,,,2020-08-21,

Rosenstone's epistemic scepticism has squarely confronted conventional historical thinking and practice, elevating issues of narrative construction, authorialism, point of view, and experimentalism to the forefront of concerns for the contemporary historian. Drawing telling parallels between conformist, conventional and intellectually conservative textual expression and film, Rosenstone has almost single-handedly 'turned' the historical profession toward a new understanding of how we can engage with the past-the filmic turn.

End-users, librarians, historians, researchers in book history and computer scientists participated in the development of remote and collaborative access to digitized Renaissance books, necessary because of the reduced accessibility to digital libraries in image mode through the Internet. The size of files for the storage of images, the lack of a standard file format exchange suitable for progressive transmission, and limited querying possibilities currently limit remote access to digital libraries. To improve accessibility, historical documents must be digitized and retro-converted to extract a detailed description of the image contents suited to users' needs. Specialists of the Renaissance have described the metadata generally required by end-users and the ideal functionalities of the digital library. The retro-conversion of historical documents is a complex process that includes image capture, metadata extraction, image storage and indexing, automatic conversion in a reusable electronic form, publication on the Internet, and data compression for faster remote access. The steps of this process cannot be developed independently. DEBORA proposes a global approach to retro-conversion from the digitization to the final functionalities of the digital library centered on users' needs. The retro-conversion process is mainly based on a document image analysis system that simultaneously extracts the metadata and compresses the images. We also propose a file format to describe compressed books as heterogeneous data (images/text/ links/annotation/physical layout and logical structure) suitable for progressive transmission, editing, and annotation. DEBORA is an exploratory project that aims at demonstrating the feasibility of the concepts by developing prototypes tested by end-users.","Inst Natl Sci Appl, LIRIS, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France","Le Bourgeois, F (corresponding author), Inst Natl Sci Appl, LIRIS, Bat 403,20 Ave A Einstein, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France.",frank.lebourgeois@liris.cnrs-lyon.fr,,,,,,29,28,28,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1433-2833,1433-2825,,INT J DOC ANAL RECOG,Int.

In doing so, it argues that Goethe's use of print and narrative work in concert to form what we might call a particular media imaginary-to reimagine the printed book not according to emerging nineteenth-century criteria of sovereignty, nationality, and permanence but instead according to values more in keeping with the technological capabilities of print media, such as transformation, diffusion, and connectivity. In his vigorous engagement with the material manifestations of his work as a key site of literary work, Goethe offers us an ideal place to explore the productive intersections that the disciplines of book history and literary history are opening up today.","McGill Univ, Dept German Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada","Piper, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept German Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",,,,,,,47,6,6,0,1,MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOC AMER,NEW YORK,"26 BROADWAY, 3RD FL, NEW YORK, NY 10003-1789 USA",0030-8129,,,PMLA,PMLA-Publ.

Rejecting that narrative, this essay calls for a review of the legacy of theory and the polemical oppositions that set it against other scholarly enterprises, like book history. In particular, it suggests that the theoretical interrogation of the category of literature in the past forty years fruitfully intersects with book history's investigation of the material conditions of literary production, opening up new possibilities for literary historiography, while also imposing new demands on it. The essay identifies two traditions of antiessentialist thought (the skeptical and the enchanted), considers the ontology of the printed literary text, and examines the legacies of, among others, Jacques Derrida and Pierre Bourdieu.","St Hughs Coll, Oxford, England","McDonald, PD (corresponding author), St Hughs Coll, Oxford, England.",,,,,,,46,30,30,0,6,MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOC AMER,NEW YORK,"10 ASTOR PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003 USA",0030-8129,,,PMLA,PMLA-Publ.

Book prize culture in Europe,JAVNOST-THE PUBLIC,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article argues that research into literary prizes can potentially be extremely pertinent in the understanding of the material and ideological conditions of the production and reception of literature and literary value. As such, the analysis of prizes awarded is similar to the wider project of book history and publishing studies, and in their fusion of cultural and economic capital, literary prizes are thus part of the larger environment in which books are produced, distributed and consumed. Through an examination of the impact of eligibility requirements and the reception of prize-winning books, particularly within the European context, this article examines the vital role of prizes in the creation of communities of writers and the development of communities of readers. The article considers a variety of methodologies for the study of literary prizes. It calls for an analysis both quantitative and qualitative, and that pays attention to both the histories and development of individual prizes, and the wider negotiations book prize culture makes with the publishing industries and culture in general, both on the common ground of European and global prize cultures, and in its regional and national differences.","Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England","Squires, C (corresponding author), Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",csquires@brookes.ac.uk,,"Squires, Claire/0000-0002-2257-9186",,,,30,7,7,0,2,EUROPEAN INST COMMUNICATION CULTURE,LJUBLJANA,"PO BOX 2511, LJUBLJANA 1001, SLOVENIA",1318-3222,,,JAVNOST-PUBLIC,Javnost-Public,DEC,2004,11,4,,,,,37,47,,10.1080/13183222.2004.11008866,,,11,Communication,Communication,881FQ,WOS:000225849200003,,,,,2020-08-21,

J,"Gunzenhauser, BJ",,,,"Gunzenhauser, BJ",,,Historicizing communities of reading in the long eighteenth century: A report from the classroom,COLLEGE LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This essay offers a case study that examines how the history of reading can provide an ideal entree to doing historicist work in the eighteenth-century literature classroom. Seeking to connect recent scholarly innovations in book history with classroom practice, the author discusses how teaching a set of texts by William Cobbett and Hannah More illuminates both the debate about lower-class literacy in late eighteenth-century Britain and the contemporary student's practice of reading. Manifestly, the texts raise the question of what 'literacy' meant in late eighteenth-century Britain, and what the political implications might be if lower-class readers were taught not merely to read, but also to write. But because these texts are less than canonical, they also raise the question of why the debate over lower-class literacy does not constitute part of the literary canon today--a question that helps students to think not just about standards of canonicity, but also about the relationship between those standards and the kinds of reading practices that are privileged in our literature classrooms.","Roosevelt Univ, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Gunzenhauser, BJ (corresponding author), Roosevelt Univ, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",,,,,,,23,2,2,0,0,WEST CHESTER UNIV,W CHESTER,"SPECIAL FUNDS OFFICE, W CHESTER, PA 19383 USA",0093-3139,,,COLL LITERATURE,Coll.

This approach reveals a persistent Restoration and eighteenth-century concern that the relatively democratic access to the press in the 1640s contributed to the political violence of the English Civil Wars. Consequently, the focus on reading also facilitates reconsidering the Habermasian 'public sphere' model through which the history of eighteenth-century criticism is generally understood.","Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA","Morrissey, L (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA.",,,,,,,65,2,2,0,0,WEST CHESTER UNIV,W CHESTER,"SPECIAL FUNDS OFFICE, W CHESTER, PA 19383 USA",0093-3139,1542-4286,,COLL LITERATURE,Coll.

In historical studies in particular, a range of work has explored the role of memory and the processes of memorialisation and of commemoration through which past events had and may continue to have meaning. Relatively little attention has been paid to the place of memory in relation to the history of geographical knowledge. Through an examination of the varied commemoration of the African explorer Mungo Park, and with reference to work in the history of science and in book history, this paper addresses this gap and discusses the implications of work on memory for an understanding of geographical knowledge in historical context.

As an independent institution, AAS is not formally associated with any university, government entity, or consortium. From its inception, the Society was founded with the desire to preserve printed sources for succeeding generations, and it has been sustained largely by private contributions from a nationwide network of members and supporters. Unlike those of other repositories, AAS collection policies are defined by date and by place of publication. Succinctly stated, its goal is to collect and preserve one copy of every item printed through the year 1876 in what is now the United States. Unlike other repository models, the AAS library serves as an active center for scholarship in early American history broadly and, more specifically, in the study of American book history. Its programs include residential research fellowships-not only for academics, but also for writers and creative artists-seminars, conferences, and the publication of a scholarly journal and of many important bibliographies. Despite these differences, the AAS resembles other national repository models in that the AAS seeks to collect, preserve, and make available materials from what is, in essence, a national repository.

But in fact, this link was achieved only through a complex designing process accomplished either directly through staging or indirectly through the mediation of a book. At the heart of an intricate body of guilds (stage or book-printing craftsmen) and religious or secular fraternities, another power concretely worked out the themes and procedures in which the king should take his place. This integration was not self-evident. Whether orderly or disorderly, the rite remained fragile and vulnerable to the hazards of history. The approach we adopted was neither essentialist nor functionalist; we preferred to concentrate on the analysis of the textual, theatrical and para-theatrical devices, on the immediate transformations they underwent and on their implicit or open manipulation by those who implemented them - such factors accounting for the fragility and mutability of the entry rite are obvious, from its long preparation in urban councils to its sometimes eventful survival in the manuscript or printed book; even the way it was accepted or understood was occasionally a subject of controversy and manipulation. At the meeting point of several disciplinary areas - theatrical semiology, book history, political and religious anthropology - we can better identify the multifarious stakes of a fascinating political ritual at the dawn of modern times. \","Univ Maine, Le Mans, France","Blanchard, J (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Le Mans, France.",,,,,,,69,3,3,0,3,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0035-3264,,,REV HISTORIQUE,Rev.

The interdependence of material and symbolic production and consumption,POETICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CRITICS ATTENTION; AUTHORS; ART; REPUTATION; BOURDIEU; SYSTEMS,"The paper of this special issue are introduced as instances of a field-theoretic approach as articulated initially in Bourdieu's institutional analysis of the literary field. This approach is presented as a sound alternative to traditional literary history and its insufficiently relational view of historiography and of the cultural object. In addition, it is situated critically with respect to book history and previous institutional analyses in a historical perspective. It focuses on the development of a literary field in eighteenth century Western Europe, at a time when the term 'literature' meant something quite different from what it means nowadays. In the cultural-sociological perspective advocated here, one must take account of the interdependency of material and symbolic production and consumption. Therefore, an approach is needed which integrates institutional analysis with an examination of the impact of conceptions of literature, that is, sets of normative ideas on the nature and function of literature. These conceptions affect the practices of all agents in the field, irrespective of whether they focus on symbolic or material production, or even on consumption. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
